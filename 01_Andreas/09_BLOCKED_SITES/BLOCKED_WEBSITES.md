# Blocked Websites & Digital Boundaries

This document serves as a central registry for all websites and platforms blocked to facilitate focus, productivity, and personal growth ("the better version of myself"). These blocks should be implemented across all devices: **PC, Laptop, Smartphone, and Tablet**.

## 🚫 Block List

| Website / Platform | URL | Category | Reasoning | Devices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pornography** | *Various (Global Block)* | Adult Content | Eliminating high-dopamine artificial stimulation; improving mental health and relationship perspective. | All |
| **Instagram** | `instagram.com` | Social Media | Prevents "doom-scrolling" and unhealthy social comparison; regains hours of focus. | All |
| **TikTok** | `tiktok.com` | Social Media | Short-form content destroys attention span and focus; extreme time sink. | All |
| **Facebook** | `facebook.com` | Social Media | Low-value information consumption; distraction from meaningful tasks. | All |
| **Twitter / X** | `twitter.com`, `x.com` | Social Media / News | High negativity and outrage cycles; reduces mental peace. | All |
| **Reddit** | `reddit.com` | Social Media / Forum | While informative, often leads to "rabbit holes" and hours of unproductive browsing. | All (except specific study subreddits) |
| **YouTube** | `youtube.com` | Entertainment | Main distraction for "educational" procrastination; recommendation engine is too addictive. | PC/Tablet (Mobile via app block) |
| **Twitch** | `twitch.tv` | Entertainment / Gaming | Passive consumption of others' lives; significant time drain. | All |
| **Netflix / Disney+** | `netflix.com`, `disneyplus.com` | Entertainment | Prevents binge-watching during productive hours or late at night. | PC / Laptop |
| **9GAG / Buzzfeed** | `9gag.com`, `buzzfeed.com` | Distraction | Purely "empty calorie" content for the brain. | All |

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### 1. PC & Laptop (Windows)
- **BlockSite App/Extension:** Primary tool for managing and scheduling blocks across browsers.
- **NextDNS:** Use for network-level blocking of adult content and tracking.
- **Cold Turkey:** Optional for "Nuclear" focus modes that block entire applications.

### 2. Smartphone & Tablet (Android - Samsung)
- **BlockSite App:** Main tool for blocking apps and websites on your Samsung phone and tablet.
- **Digital Wellbeing:** Use in combination with BlockSite for app timers and "Focus Mode".
- **App Deletion:** Continue to delete high-distraction apps entirely, using the browser with BlockSite for essential-only access.

## 🎯 Goal: 1% Better Every Day
By removing these digital obstacles, the path to Spanish fluency, fitness goals, and academic success becomes significantly clearer. Focus on the **intrinsic motivation** (*Eigenes Leben*) rather than cheap digital dopamine.
