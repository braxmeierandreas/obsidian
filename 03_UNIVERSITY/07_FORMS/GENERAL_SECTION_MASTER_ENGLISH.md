# **A. General Section**

**Part I**


**General Regulations**


**§ 2** **Admission Requirements**


(1) A university degree or equivalent qualification is a prerequisite for admission to the Master Programmes as defined in §
1.1.


(2) The overall credit volume requirement, earned from the first degree as per section 1 and the planned master’s degree,
is 300 credit points in total. Students with insufficient credit points must take further modules to secure the credits required. These modules will be determined in consultation with the dean of studies. The choice of modules will take into
account the credits previously earned and the student’s abilities, as well as the specific requirements of the master’s
programme in question.


(3) Further admission requirements for each master’s programme are laid down in specific regulations.


**§ 2 a** **Discontinuation of a degree programme**


(1) Students will no longer be admitted or enrolled for the first or no longer offered higher semesters in a discontinued degree programme from the time of discontinuation.


(2) A study programme-specific transition period applies. The transition period is calculated as 1.5 times the standard period of study rounded up to a full semester. It begins from the time of the Senate's revocation.


(3) All study and examination regulations for the respective degree programme shall cease to apply as soon as the transition period in accordance with Paragraph 2 has expired.


(4) As long as the transitional period in accordance with Paragraph 2 has not yet been reached, students in discontinued
degree programmes shall be permitted to take examinations in accordance with the relevant study and examination
regulations; they shall be entitled to an appropriate range of courses, academic achievements and examinations.


(5) If students are unable to complete their studies within the above-mentioned period for reasons beyond their control, or
in cases of § 32 (4) No. 5 LHG, the Head of the Examination Office will make an individual decision upon request.


**§ 3** **Normative Time-to-degree and Credit System**


(1) The normative time-to-degree for all study programmes listed in § 1.1 is defined in the Specific Section. It encompasses the theoretical curricular semesters as well as all examinations and the master’s thesis.


(2) Study programmes have a modular structure. A module comprises several teaching components linked in terms of
content and timing. Each component is awarded a number of credit points which correspond to the length of time required for the successful completion of the component. All modules are graded. The criteria for the award of credit
points comply with the requirements of the ECTS (European Credit Transfer System). Each credit is equivalent to 30
hours‘ work.


(3) The total number of mandatory and elective modules required for the successful completion of the programme is laid
down in the Specific Section.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) Allg. M-SPO - 6


(4) The order and type of modules as laid down in the Specific Section can, for compelling reasons and in individual cases, be altered by the Faculty Board responsible, for the duration of one curricular semester.


(5) For degree programmes with courses offered annually, the sequence of curricular semesters 1 and 2 shall be reversed, if necessary, depending on the time of commencement of the degree programme.


(6) The modules specified in the special section (courses, non-graded and graded assessments) will be offered from the
time a successor version of the degree programme comes into force up to 1.5 times the standard period of study
rounded up to a full semester; there is an entitlement to an appropriate range of courses, academic credits and examinations.


**§ 3a** **Bilingual study programmes**


In selected study programmes it is possible to complete a "Bilingual study programme". Upon application, this will be
noted in the degree certificate as well as in a separate certificate. Of the 90 ECTS credits of the respective master's
programme, at least 30 ECTS credits each must be completed in English and German, of which at least 15 ECTS
credits must be completed without a thesis. In the non-native language(s), proof of level C1 of the Common European
Framework of Reference must also be provided. The required language examination(s) must not extend the period of
study and must therefore be successfully completed before the last examination required for graduation, i.e., as a rule
before submission of the thesis. For further details, please refer to the Specific Section of the SPO for the relevant degree programmes.


**§ 4** **Structure of Examinations**


(1) For successful completion of studies, 90 credit points, depending on the type of programme, must be earned. Passed
modules are awarded the number of credit points laid down in the Specific Section. The Specific Section defines the
individual graded and non-graded (pass/fail) assessments for the modules as well as the module grades of the programme. Graded assessments are normally examined in conjunction with the relevant course and are related to the
course content.


(2) The Specific Section defines the non-graded assessments for the mandatory and elective courses of the individual
modules of the curricular semester which are required for successful completion the programme.


**§ 5** **Permanent Withrawal from Programme and Loss of Right to be Assessed, Deadlines**


(1) The credit requirements of the study programme (90 credit points) should be successfully completed within the normative time-to-degree. An accelerated track of studies enabling completion of credit requirements prior to these deadlines
is possible.


(2) The students will be informed of the number and type of graded and non-graded assessments required for the completion of a module on a timely basis. They will also be informed of the deadlines for such assessments as well as the assignment and submission dates for the master’s thesis.


(3) The right to be assessed is forfeited and permanent withdrawal from the programme is required where the graded and
non-graded assessments have not been successfully completed within three semesters of the deadline defined in section one, unless the cause of the delay lies outside the student's control.


(4) Any student entitled to parental leave under the relevant current law (BEEG), is entitled to complete certain graded or
non-graded assessments at a point in time later than the deadline laid down in the examination regulations.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) Allg. M-SPO - 7


(5) Any student who is able to study but is unable to attend lectures or complete the required non-graded assessment due
to a longer illness, or a longer or permanent disability, is entitled to complete certain graded or non-graded assessments at a point in time later than the deadline laid down in the examination regulations. The extension period can be
no more than three years. §18 (7) applies to the processing time for the master's thesis. The student must produce
pertinent documentation, in most cases a doctor’s note. In case of doubt, the university can require the student to provide a doctor’s note from a doctor of the university’s choice. Students must inform the university immediately of any
changes in their circumstances.


(6) The regulations for the extension of deadlines as stated in Paragraph 5 above also apply to any student who is:


1. A member of the Students’ Parliament (Studierendenrat) and the Student Council (Allgemeinen Stud
ierendenausschuss AStA) according to the founding statutes of the Student Parliament (Verfassten Studierendenschaft).


2. A member of a German national olympic, scouting, reserve or team sports squad, or of a young hopefuls

squad 1 and 2, which belongs to a federal association of the German Olympic Sports Confederation.


3. A member of a state sports squad, or any other athlete designated as an elite athlete on an individual basis

by the Elite Sports Officer of the University Board of Executives according to the current HFU list of criteria.


If elite athletes end their sporting career during their academic studies, the Elite Sports Officer of the University Board
of Executives will decide at what point in time a further extension of the deadline will no longer be permitted.


(7) Any student entitled to caregiving leave is entitled to complete certain graded or non-graded assessments at a point in
time later than the deadline laid down in the examination regulations.


**§ 6** **Graded and Non-graded Assessments**


(1) All assessments will, as a rule, take place during the examination period outside the lecture period of a given semester.


(2) Where an individual can prove satisfactorily that due to prolonged or permanent impairment in accordance with § 32,
(4) (5) of the LHG, they are unable to complete the exam in whole or in part in the prescribed manner, the Faculty Examination Board in question will allow suitable measures to be taken to compensate for the impairment. A medical or
psychological certificate is required for this purpose.


(3) For each student enrolled for examinations, the Examinations Office will set up an account to record bonus points for
all passed modules and malus points for all failed modules.


(4) Where a module is passed, its credit points are credited to the applicable bonus account. Where a graded or nongraded assessment is failed, its credit points are recorded in the applicable malus account.


(5) The language of instruction in the course is usually German and/or English. Examinations are generally held in the
language in which the course of the module to be examined was held. This is specified in the module description. The
examiner announces the language and examination modalities at the beginning of the semester.


(6) It must be possible to establish the identity of the person to be examined.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) Allg. M-SPO - 8


**§ 7** **Oral Examinations**


(1) As a rule, all oral examinations will be taken by at least two examiners (viva voce examination) or an examiner in the
presence of an observer (§ 15). They can be held as group or individual examinations. The grade is the average of the
individual grades awarded by the examinors.


(2) The duration of an oral examination for each person to be examined is at least 15 but no more than 30 minutes.


(3) The main content matter and the results must be recorded in written form. The result should be communicated to the
person examined at the end of the oral examination.


(4) Any student wishing to take the same examination at a later point in time is permitted to view the examination if space
allows and if the examinee is in agreement. Student observers are not permitted to be present when feedback and examination results are being given.


(5) In exceptional cases, with the consent of the candidate and in accordance with the regulations of §§ 32a and 32b LHG,
the examination may also be conducted using electronic information and communication systems (online).


**§ 8** **Written Examinations and Other Written Assignments**


(1) In written examinations and other written assignments students should demonstrate that they are capable of solving
problems and completing tasks using the standard methods of their subject, within a limited time frame and with limited
access to resources. The examination also seeks to determine whether students possess the requisite basic
knowledge. An examination may offer a choice of different topics.


(2) The grading period should not exceed four weeks.


(3) The duration of a written examination is 90 minutes. Any exceptions are laid down in the Specific Section.


(4) Written examinations may be conducted entirely or in part, by means of multiple-choice questions.


(5) In exceptional cases, a written examination may be taken in whole or in part using electronic information and communication systems (online). In this case, § 32 a and § 32 b LHG apply.


**§ 9** **Grading**


(1) Assessments can be a non-graded assessment, a graded assessment or a combination of the two. Non-graded assessments are awarded a “pass” or “fail”. Graded assessments are awarded a grade.


(2) The grades for the different graded assessments are set by the examiner in question. The following grades are to be
used when marking graded assessments:

1; 1.3 = very good = outstanding performance

1.7; 2; 2.3 = good = performance which is significantly above average


2.7; 3; 3.3 = satisfactory = average performance

3.7; 4 = adequate = performance which, despite shortcomings still satisfies requirements

5 = inadequate = performance which, due to significant shortcomings, no longer satisfies
requirements


(3) Where a graded assessment is made up of several parts with individual grades, the overall grade is calculated as an
average of the appropriately weighted individual grades.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) Allg. M-SPO - 9


(4) The module grade is as follows:


for an average of up to and including 1.5 = very good

for an average of between 1.6 and up to and including 2.5 = good

for an average of between 2.6 and up to and including 3.5 = satisfactory


for an average of between 3.6 and up to and including 4.0 = adequate

anything below an average of 4.1 = inadequate (graded as 5.0)


(5) When calculating the final grade § 21.2 applies in the same manner.


(6) In calculating the average, the grade is rounded only to the first decimal place; all other decimals are ignored without
rounding.


(7) Grades achieved under these Study and Examination Regulations are converted to the ECTS grading system in accordance with the following table (due to the limited amount of data available, a conversion on the basis of statistical
data is not possible).


German Grade ECTS Grade


1.0 - 1.5 A


1.6 - 2.3 B


2.4 - 3.0 C


3.1 - 3.7 D


3.8 - 4.0 E


4.1 - 5.0 F


(8) The assignment grades earned during a study semester abroad are converted using the “Standard HFU Table for the
Calculation of Grades Earned Abroad” (Tabelle für die HFU-einheitliche Umrechnung von Auslandsprüfungsleistungen).


(9) The module grade is calculated as follows: the grades of each of the module’s graded assessments are multiplied by
the appropriate credit points. The results are then added and divided by the total number of credits of all the module
assessments. The result is rounded to the first decimal point.


**§ 10** **Unexcused Absence, Withdrawal, Deception, Breach of Regulation**


(1) Absence or withdrawal from an examination without good reason will be awarded a grade of 5.0. The same applies
where a written assessment is not completed within the required period of time. Students may withdraw once from an
examination for which they are registered, without being required to give a reason. To do so an application must be
filed with the Examinations Office in writing no later than one day prior to the examination (if an assessment consists of
several parts, before the final part).


Multiple withdrawals from examinations are permitted for any student who is:


1. A member of the Student Parliament (Studierendenrat) and the Student Council (Allgemeinen Studierendenauss
chuss AStA) in accordance with the founding statutes of the Student Parliament (Verfassten
Studierendenschaft).


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) Allg. M-SPO - 10


2. A member of a German national olympic, scouting, reserve, or team sports squad, or of a young hopefuls squad

1 and 2, which belongs to a federal association of the German Olympic Sports Confederation.


3. A member of a state sports squad, or any other athlete designated by the Elite Sports Officer of the University

Board of Executives as an elite athlete on an individual basis, according to the current HFU list of criteria.


If elite athletes end their sporting career during their academic studies, the Elite Sports Officer of the University Board
of Executives will decide at what point in time a further extension of the deadline will no longer be permitted.


(2) A credible reason for absence or withdrawal must be submitted promptly and in writing. In case of illness, a doctor's
note, and in case of doubt, a note from a doctor nominated by the university may be required. Where the reason given
is deemed valid, a new examination date will be set.


(3) The illness of a child for which the student is the legal guardian is assigned the same status as the student's own illness in the case of observance of deadlines for initial examination registration, examination resits and reasons for absence from examinations / graded assessments.


(4) Where a student attempts to influence the result of an examination through deception or the use of non-admissible
aids, the examination will be awarded the grade of 5.0. Any person disrupting the proper course of an examination may
be excluded by the examiner responsible. In such a case, the assessment will be awarded the grade of 5.0. In serious
cases of disturbance or deception, the Faculty Examination Board can request that the university exclude such a person from taking part in any further examinations. Plagiarism is considered a serious offense.

(5) In addition to the measures specified in Paragraph 4, the Faculty Examination Board may apply to the Vice-President
for Academics and Diversity to exclude the person being examined from taking any further examinations


**§ 11** **Pass and Fail**


(1) A module has been passed when a minimum module grade of 4.0 has been awarded. If the module assessment consists of several individual assessments, it is only passed when all the individual assessments have been awarded a
minimum grade of 4.0. A module has been passed when all assessments of the module have been passed.


(2) An assessment in the form of a graded assessment has been passed when a minimum grade of 4.0 has been awarded. Any further assessment requirements imposed should be marked as a footnote in the Specific Section of the General Study and Examination Regulations.


(3) An assessment in the form of a non-graded assessment has been passed when a “pass” has been awarded.


(4) An assessment which is a combination of graded assessment and non-graded assessment has been passed when a
minimum grade of 4.0 has been awarded in the graded assessment and a “pass” is awarded in the non-graded assessment. Any further assessment requirements should be marked as a footnote in the Specific Section of the General
Study and Examination Regulations. In such a case, registration or withdrawal is only possible from the assessment as
a whole, not from the individual parts of the assessment.


(5) The master’s programme has been passed once all module examinations and the master’s thesis have been passed
with a minimum grade of 4.0.


(6) If a module has not been passed or the Master’s thesis was awarded a grade of less than 4.0, this should be communicated to the student being examined. If applicable, the student must also be informed as to whether and, if applicable, to what extent and within which deadlines, the assessment in question / the master’s thesis can be retaken.


(7) If the master’s degree programme has been failed, upon provision of the relevant documents and the notice of deregistration, the student can apply for a certificate showing the graded and non-graded assessments passed and the relevant grades. The certificate will also show that the master’s degree programme was not passed.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) Allg. M-SPO - 11


**§ 12** **Resits**


(1) Examinations which have already been passed cannot be retaken.


(2) Examinations which have not been passed must be retaken. Failed examinations are awarded the number of malus
points laid out in the Specific Section.


(3) The resit examination shall be taken at the earliest at the beginning of and at the latest within the examination period of
the respective following semester. Resit examinations must be offered every semester even in courses offered annually. Exceptions must be justified to the dean of studies. These duties of the Dean of Studies may be delegated to a designated office.


**§ 13** **Accreditation of Study Periods, Accreditation (Graded / Non-Graded) of prior Learning**
**Accreditation of Prior and Experiential Learning**


(1) Credits and degrees which have been awarded at other German state and state-recognised universities and Cooperative State Universities or from degree programmes in foreign state or state-recognised universities, will be accredited
upon request, on the condition that there is no significant difference between such awards and the awards which they
are to substitute. The purpose of accreditation is to determine examinations to be taken and to allow continuation of
studies or admission to further degree programmes. The onus is on the university to prove that an application does not
fulfill the requirements for accreditation.


In the case of a change of degree programme within Furtwangen University, passed assessments and failed examination attempts in courses which are common to both degree programmes will be officially accredited after a hearing of
the party involved.


(2) Prior and experiential learning will be accredited upon request if the type and level of knowledge and skills derived
from the experience are equivalent to the criteria of the standard course requirements. The onus is on the applicant to
prove that their application fulfills the requirements for accreditation. The volume of credit permissible from prior and
experiential learning should not exceed 50% of the total degree programme award.


(3) Accreditation cannot be awarded for assessments which the student has already passed, failed or withdrawn from at
Furtwangen University. Application for accreditation must be made to the chairperson of the Faculty Examination
Board/dean of studies within three weeks of the start of lectures in a semester. After that period accreditation can only
be considered if proof for _restitutio in integrum_ is submitted. The onus is on the applicant to supply the pertinent documentation for accreditation. Where certificates or documents are neither in German or English, a certified German
translation may be required. The following documents must be submitted:


      - Accreditation in accordance with Paragraph 1: unadjusted transcript of records, module description with learning objectives, methods of teaching, content, workload, prerequisites and grading system used to assess the
module.


      - Accreditation in accordance with Paragraph 2: vocational training regulations, general examination regulations, assessment tasks


The final decision regarding accreditation must be made by the end of the enrolment period of the semester in which
the completed application was made to the chairperson of the Faculty Examination Board/dean of studies. Where accreditation is refused or only partially granted, the rationale for the decision must be set out in writing and include information regarding appeal procedures. These duties of the Dean of Studies may be delegated to a designated office.


(4) Should existing bilateral agreements between Germany and other countries pertaining to equivalency in universities
vary from paragraphs 1 to 3 in favour of foreign university students, the regulations of these equivalency agreements
take precedence.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) Allg. M-SPO - 12


(5) Grades for accredited graded assessments or non-graded assessments will be carried forward directly to the students
record where the grading system is comparable, or where possible be calculated according to the table in § 10.7 and
will contribute to the total grade. In the case of ungraded credits for examinations or modules for which the General
Study and Examination Regulations require a grade, the grade of 4.0 will be awarded. Accredited non-graded assessments and graded assessments can be clearly marked in the certificate. Credit points for the accredited modules
will be awarded to the bonus account and any failed graded or non-graded assessments will be listed in the malus account.


**§ 14** **Faculty Examination Board**


(1) In order to organise examinations and fulfill other tasks required by the Study and Examination Regulations, each faculty will form a Faculty Examination Board consisting of all full-time professors in the faculty. The chairperson is the
vice-dean elected from amongst all deans of studies.


(2) The Faculty Examination Board ensures that the Study and Examination Regulations are adhered to. The Faculty Examination Board may delegate certain of the tasks it is responsible for to the chairperson, the dean or the dean of studies responsible.


(3) The members of the Faculty Examination Board have the right to be present at any examinations.


(4) The members of the Faculty Examination Board have by virtue of their office a duty of confidentiality.


(5) The Faculty Examination Board appoints the examiners and observers.


(6) The Faculty Examination Board assigns the theses and appoints thesis supervisors.


(7) The Faculty Examination Board deals with all examinations appeals and, where applicable, issues official statements.


(8) The Faculty Examination Board is responsible for all disciplinary decisions related to the breach of examination regulations (see § 10).


(9) The Faculty Examination Committee is responsible for decisions regarding accreditation of study periods, grades and
prior learning (§ 13), unless the right of delegation has been exercised in accordance with Paragraph 2.


**§ 14 a Central Examination Board**


(1) Furtwangen University (HFU) will set up a Central Examination Board (ZPA).


(2) Members of the Central Examination Board are the Vice-President for Academics and Diversity, the respective chairpersons of the Faculty Examination Boards/Vice-Dean for Academics, the Head of the Examinations Office and the
Head of the Student Affairs Department. The Head of the Examinations Office chairs the committee. Non-voting members of the Central Examination Board are the Deputy Head of the Examination Office, the Deputy Head of the Student
Affairs Department and the Assistant to the Vice-President for Academics and Diversity. If a member with voting rights
is unable to attend, a substitute must be nominated; in the case of a Vice-Dean for Academics, a member of the Department Office or a dean of studies of the faculty concerned.


(3) The Central Examination Board is responsible for coordinating the standard application of the Study and Examination
Regulations (SPO), dealing with cross-faculty examination issues and coordinating cross-faculty teaching and quality
issues.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) Allg. M-SPO - 13


**§ 15** **Examiners and Observers**


(1) Examinations which are not taken concurrently with a lecture can normally only be taken by professors. Other lecturers, tenured or otherwise, may be appointed as examiners where professors are not available. Other persons with professional and academic experience and a qualification at least equal to that which forms the basis of the examination,
may be appointed as examiners.

**Part II:**


**Master’s Degree Programme**


**§ 17** **Programme Content**


(1) The Specific Section defines the type of assessments required for the mandatory and elective modules.


(2) The assessments are based on the subject matter of the module components as set out in the Specific Section.


**§ 17 a** **Permanent Failure to Complete Studies**


The study programme is considered permanently failed, if

1. the master’s thesis has not been passed at the second attempt or is considered failed, or

2. the number of malus points from assessments exceeds 72 (48 for two-semester master’s programme) credit
points, or

3. the deadline for completing the programme has been exceeded (cf. § 5.3).

In all three cases the student loses the right to be examined for the degree programme in question and will be
exmatriculated.


**§ 18** **Registration, Assignment and Completion Deadline for the Master’s Thesis**


(1) The master’s thesis is a graded assessment the aim of which is to indicate that a student is able to independently
complete an assigned task related to their subject area within a limited timeframe using sound scientific methodology.


(2) The registration of the master’s thesis takes place within the registration period. The registration must include the topic,
name of primary supervisor, name of secondary supervisor (if known) and start and submission date of the thesis. The
document must be signed by the candidate and the primary supervisor/university supervisor. A starting date other than
01 March or 01 September must be approved by the Faculty Examination Board. A charge is payable for late registration. Faculties can set an alternative deadline in their Thesis Stipulations.


(3) Having checked and confirmed the registration using the full particulars provided above (see Paragraph 2), the Faculty
Examination Board will assign the master’s thesis. Topic and deadlines must be recorded on the file. If a master’s thesis has not been registered or does not fulfil the registration requirements defined by the individual faculties in their
Thesis Stipulations, the master’s thesis cannot be undertaken or will not be recognised.


(4) The master’s thesis will be assigned and supervised by a professor or a member of the academic staff or, if such are
not available as examiners, by a tenured or non-tenured lecturer (primary supervisor). The secondary thesis supervisor
may also be a person with practical and training experience. Both supervisors must have gained a master’s degree or
a higher degree, or an equivalent qualification. The consent of the chairperson of the Faculty Examination Board is required if the master’s thesis is to be undertaken in an establishment outside the university.


(5) Master’s thesis topics will be announced by the primary supervisors in the faculty or by companies. Candidates may
approach primary supervisors in the faculty with their own proposals; topics from other faculties may also be undertaken. The Faculty Examination Board will decide on the assignment of topics and the allocation of supervisors to the individual topics or candidates. Topic, remit and scope of the master’s thesis are to be defined by the supervisor in a
manner which ensures that the time limit for the master’s thesis can be adhered to. The master’s thesis can also be


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) Allg. M-SPO - 15


undertaken as group work, provided that individual contributions which are to be graded can be clearly distinguished
and assessed.


(6) An application for a subsequent change of topic must be submitted to the dean of studies on prior arrangement with
the thesis supervisor and the departmental office must be notified. If the change merely involves the final wording of a
provisional thesis topic, it is sufficient for the primary thesis supervisor to make a corresponding insertion on the master’s Thesis Registration Form.


(7) The time limit for completion of the master’s thesis is six months.


1. If this is necessary to ensure equal examination conditions or for reasons for which the person to be examined is

not responsible, the processing time may be extended to a maximum of nine months; the decision on this is made
by the dean of studies on the basis of a statement by the supervisor. These duties of the Dean of Studies may be
delegated to a designated office.


2. The candidate must immediately apply to the Head of the Examination Office for an interruption of the master's

thesis due to illness or other reasons beyond the candidate’s control, stating and providing evidence of the reasons. The interruption may not exceed a total of two months; in the event of a longer interruption, withdrawal may
be approved by the Head of the Examination Office.


(8) Withdrawal in accordance with § 10.1, after a thesis has been registered, is only possible under exceptional circumstances and is subject to the permission of the Faculty Examination Board, in the cases of Para. 7, No. 2 by the head
of the examination office. In such cases, a new thesis topic must be applied for within two months of the withdrawal
date. In exceptional cases the final decision will be taken by the Head of the Examinations Office.


**§ 19** **Submission and Assessment of the Master’s Thesis**


(1) The final papers shall be submitted in electronic form at the specified time. The time of submission is to be made part
of the records. The supervisors may request additional print copies, which may not deviate from the electronic form.
The details for the submission of theses are regulated by the “Thesis Stipulations" of the Faculty Examination Boards.


(2) When submitting the thesis, a written assurance must be given that the thesis – in the case of a group thesis, the part
of the thesis marked accordingly – has been written independently and that no sources and aids other than those
specified have been used. This assurance must be signed by the student’s own hand, which can also be transmitted
digitally.


(3) The master’s thesis is assessed by two examiners (primary and secondary supervisors). The assessment should be
completed within six weeks. Upon request, three weeks after the submission of the thesis, the primary supervisor can
inform the Examinations Office whether or not the thesis has been passed.


(4) The thesis grade is the arithmetical average of the grades awarded by the two examiners. It forms part of the final
grade, weighted as defined in the Specific Section of the SPO. If the grades of the two examiners diverge by more than
2.0, or if only one of the examiners awards the thesis a grade of 5.0 (Fail), the two examiners will be asked to give their
rationale for the grades awarded. The Faculty Examination Board will then decide whether a third review should be
undertaken by a professor of Furtwangen University. If two of the three markers award the thesis a grade of 5.0 (Fail),
the master’s thesis has been failed. However, if at least two of the examinors award the thesis a grade of 4.0, the
grade of the master’s thesis will be the arithmetical average of the grades awarded by the three examinors. If in doing
so, this results in an arithmetical average of less than 4.0 (adequate), the master’s thesis will be awarded a 4.0.


(5) In cases where a candidate who is employed externally agrees to an obligation of confidentiality, the thesis is assessed only on the basis of the documentation submitted; it may not contain any confidential sections. The documentation may contain a non-disclosure notice effective for a maximum of five years. This must, however, be explicitly
agreed prior to assignment of the thesis by the primary and secondary supervisors of the thesis. Such an agreement
should be signed by the dean of the faculty and the university supervisor.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) Allg. M-SPO - 16


(6) A master’s thesis that is discontinued or not submitted on time will be graded as a “Fail” (5.0).


(7) If a master’s thesis receives a grade of less than 4.0, it may be retaken once; a second resit is not possible. Application
for the setting of a new topic must be made in writing to the chairperson of the Faculty Examination Board no later than
two months following the notification of failure. Failure to comply with this deadline will result in loss of entitlement to be
examined except in cases where the candidate can not be held responsible for the delay. In exceptional cases the final
decision will be taken by the Head of the Examinations Office.


(8) The thesis module includes a colloquium or a presentation. Further details can be set out in the thesis stipulations of
the individual faculties.


(9) The Faculty Examination Board decide upon faculty-specific thesis stipulations which affect, for example, the acceptance stipulations, the presentation, the costs, the place of work, external theses, the formal layout and design, and
the data storage devices which are to be submitted.


**§ 20** **Additional Modules / Subjects and Required Elective Subjects**


(1) Students may take examinations in modules or subjects other than those prescribed (additional subjects).


(2) The status of additional subjects cannot be changed to that of required elective subject. A graded additional subject
may be listed on the grades certificate upon request. Additional subjects do not affect the student´s final grade.


(3) Required elective courses become mandatory examined courses upon registration for the class which means that they
must also be passed even if they are not a requirement of the master’s degree. Withdrawal from an elective is in principle not permitted. If the elective is no longer offered, the dean of studies will assign a new required elective course as a substitute.
The Head of the Examinations Office will make decisions regarding any other exceptions in special cases upon request.


**§ 21** **Composition of Final Grade and Grades Certificate**


(1) In accordance with § 9.4-6, the final grade is calculated from the module grades weighted in accordance with their
credit points.


(2) For outstanding results (final grade of 1.3 or above) the grade "Passed with Distinction" is awarded.


(3) A grades certificate shall be issued immediately, if possible, within four weeks of completion of the studies. The certificate will contain the module grades, the topic and grade of the master’s thesis, as well as the final grade and the total
credit points awarded in accordance with § 2.2; the grades will include the decimal value in brackets as set down in
§ 9.6. Furthermore, the total number of credit points, the confirmation of any period of study abroad, the area of specialisation, as well as, upon request, the results of the examinations in any additional subjects, the length of time required to successfully complete the degree, and, if applicable, bilingual study, shall be included in the certificate.


(4) The certificate bears the date of the day on which the final examination was completed. It is signed by the Deputy
President or, in exceptional cases, by the Vice-President for Learning and Diversity and by the relevant dean or, in exceptional cases, by the Vice-Dean for Academics, and bears the seal of Furtwangen University - Information Technology, Engineering, Business, Media, Health Sciences.


(5) The language of the grades certificate (German / English) is defined in the Specific Section. A translation into the other
language can be provided upon request.


(6) Furtwangen University issues a Diploma Supplement in English.


(7) Furtwangen University produces an ECTS table which shows the breakdown of the final grade in percentages for every degree programme.

(6) The master’s degree certificate is issued at the same time as the grades certificate and has the same date. This certifies the award of the master’s degree. The master's degree certificate is signed by the President or, in exceptional
cases, by the Deputy President or the Vice-President for Learning and Diversity, and bears the seal of Furtwangen
University - Information Technology, Engineering, Business, Media, Health Sciences.


**§ 23** **Invalid Graded / Non-Graded Assessments and / or Invalid Degree**


(1) Where the examinee is found guilty of deception on a graded / non-graded assessment and such fact only becomes
known after the grades certificate was issued, the relevant grade can be corrected in accordance with § 10.4. If necessary, modules can be awarded a 5.0 and the degree can be declared failed. The same applies to the master‘s thesis.


(2) Where the requirements for the completion of a module have not been met, but no deception was intended by the examinee and this fact only becomes known after the grades certificate was issued, then no further action will be taken.
In cases where intentional deception was used to pass a graded / non-graded assessment or a module, such a graded
/ non-graded assessment or module can be awarded a 5.0 and the degree can be declared failed.


(3) Before a decision is made, an opportunity for a hearing must be given. The decision is taken by the relevant Faculty
Examination Board in accordance with Paragraphs 1 and 2.


(4) The incorrect grades certificate must be retracted and, if applicable, a replacement must be issued. Should a graded /
non-graded assessment or the degree programme as a whole be declared failed as a result of deception, the master’s
degree certificate must be revoked together with the incorrect grades certificate. A decision made on the basis of Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2, sentence 2, is only possible within five years of the date of issue of the grades certificate

**§ 24** **Inspection of Examination Files**


Upon request, the examinee can inspect their written work at an appropriate time and place, generally on the university
premises, for up to a year after the completion of an assessment; § 29 of the Landesverwaltungsverfahrensgesetz is
not affected.


**§ 24 a Leave of Absence**


Students on leave of absence are not permitted to participate in any examination (see § 61.3 of the Landeshochschulgesetzes (LHG) for exceptions relating to the maternity rights law). Due to an extension of the submission date, work begun in the previous semester may be submitted to be completed in the following semester.


**§ 24 b Maternity Rights, Parental Leave, Caregiving**


(1) If maternity rights are applied for in accordance with the law for the protection of working mothers (“Mutterschutzgesetz”, MuSchG), applicable deadlines must be adhered to and pertinent documentation must be enclosed with the application. Deadlines for maternity rights take precedence over any other deadlines in the Study and Examination Regulations. The period of maternity leave is not included in the deadline applicable in § 5.3.


(2) Mothers-to-be are permitted to take examinations during maternity leave, however the Examinations Office must be
informed of this in writing. This regulation is valid for the entire semester if a part of the maternity leave takes place
during the semester.


(3) Similarly, if parental leave is applied for in accordance with current German regulations (BEEG), the applicable deadlines must be adhered to. Students applying for parental leave must notify the faculty examination board in writing of
the time period requested at least four weeks prior to the start of the parental leave. Pertinent documentation should be
enclosed with the application. The dean of studies will ascertain whether the applicant fulfils the legal requirements for
parental leave and will inform the applicant of the results and of the new examination dates.


(4) If maternity or parental leave take place during study leave, it is still possible to take examinations. (See § 61.3, LGG).
A separate exam registration must be carried out by the required deadline. Recognition of exam results without prior
registration is not possible.


(5) Caregiving leave for a close relative as set out under the relevant current Caregiving Leave Law and §§ 14 and 15 of
the eleventh book of the Social Welfare Statutes can be granted upon request. Pertinent documentation should be enclosed with the application. The period of caregiving leave is not taken into consideration in the deadline set down in
§ 5.3.
