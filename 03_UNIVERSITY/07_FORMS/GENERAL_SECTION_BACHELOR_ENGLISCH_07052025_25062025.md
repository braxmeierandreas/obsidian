# **A. General Section**

**Part I:**


**General Regulations**


**§ 2** **Normative Time-to-degree, Programme Structure and Credit System**


(1) The normative time-to-degree for all study programmes listed in § 1.1 is defined in the Specific Section. It encompasses the theoretical taught semesters and the mandatory internship semesters including all examinations as well as
the bachelor’s thesis.


(2) The structure of the study programmes listed in § 1.1 is divided into the Foundation Studies which are completed within
two curricular semesters, and the Advanced Studies which are completed within a further five semesters. In the Physiotherapy Plus programme with credit transfer model, the advanced studies comprise four semesters.


(3) If the “Technical Orientation” prep course or the “IT Orientation” prep course is taken as an integral part of a study
programme in accordance with § 1.2, the normative time-to-degree of this study programme is extended to 8 semesters.


(4) All study programmes have a modular structure. A module comprises several teaching components linked in terms of
content and timing. Each component is awarded a number of credit points which correspond to the length of time required for the successful completion of the component. With the exception of the internship semester, all modules are
graded. The criteria for the award of credit points comply with the requirements of the ECTS (European Credit Transfer
System). Each credit is equivalent to 30 hours‘ work.


(5) For successful completion of studies, a total of 210 credit points must be gained. A total of 180 credit points must be
earned to successfully complete the Physiotherapy Plus degree progamme. The mandatory and elective modules required for successful completion of studies are defined for each study programme in the Specific Section. The mandatory modules encompass the modules which must be covered during each curricular semester. Elective modules are
the modules which the student must select from the modules offered in each curricular semester in the manner prescribed within the Specific Section.


(6) The order and type of modules as laid down in the Specific Section can, for compelling reasons and in individual cases, be altered by the Faculty Board responsible, for the duration of one semester.


(7) The modules specified in the special section (courses, coursework and examinations) will be offered from the time a
successor version of the degree programme comes into force up to 1.5 times the standard period of study rounded up
to a full semester; there is an entitlement to an appropriate range of courses, academic credits and examinations.


**§ 2 a** **Discontinuation of a degree programme**


(1) Students will no longer be admitted or enrolled for the first or no longer offered higher semesters in a discontinued
degree programme from the time of discontinuation.


(2) A study programme-specific transition period applies. The transition period is calculated as 1.5 times the standard
period of study rounded up to a full semester. It begins from the time of the Senate's revocation.


(3) All study and examination regulations for the respective degree programme shall cease to apply as soon as the transitional period in accordance with Paragraph 2 has expired.


(4) As long as the transitional period in accordance with Paragraph 2 has not yet expired, students in discontinued degree
programmes shall be permitted to take examinations in accordance with the relevant study and examination regulations; they shall be entitled to an appropriate range of courses, academic credits and examinations.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 7/32


(5) If students are unable to complete their studies within the above-mentioned period for reasons beyond their control or
in cases of § 32 Paragraph 4 No. 5 LHG, the Head of the Examination Office will make an individual decision upon request.


**§ 3** **Mandatory Internship Semester**


(1) All study programmes as listed in § 1.1 encompass a 6-month, ungraded, mandatory internship semester. Exceptions
are to be regulated in the Specific Section.


(2) For the internship semester to be recognised under examination law, the student must provide evidence of at least 95
days of attendance in a company or in another institution of professional practice (internship position) after deduction
of any days of absence (practical work). During the internship semester, students will be supervised by a professor.
More specific regulations can be laid out in the Specific Section of the Study and Examination Regulations of the individual faculties.


(3) The university cooperates with the employer in all aspects of the students’ internship.


(4) Students must provide written proof of their training during the internship in accordance with the Specific Section of the
Study and Examinations Regulations for their degree programme. At the end of the internship semester, the employer
must issue the student with a confirmation of employment which should include the type and content of the work, as
well as the starting and finishing dates of the employment and any periods of absence. This written proof forms the basis for the decision as to whether or not a student has successfully completed the internship. Where the internship is
not deemed successfully completed, it can be retaken once. During the internship semester, a student may only
change their employer in exceptional circumstances, for good reason and only with the permission of the Faculty Examination Board. The final decision will be taken by the respective Faculty Examination Board.


(5) The acquisition of an internship position is the student’s responsibility. The proposed internship must be approved by
the dean of faculty or a nominated professor. In case of doubt, the final decision will be taken by the Faculty Examination Board.


(6) For the internship in the 3rd and 4th semester of the curriculum, the Faculty Board can define specific admission criteria. An internship semester during a semester later than the 4 [th] taught semester can only be embarked upon provided
the Foundation Studies have been successfully completed. Exception (applicable only where the internship semester
takes place during the 5 [th] semester): students with no more than one incomplete Foundation Studies credit requirement may apply to the dean for admission to the internship semester. As the deadline has been exceeded, this permission is then subject to agreement by the Head of the Examinations Office. (§ 5.3).


(7) The faculties are responsible for the organisational details of the internship semesters, for the coordination of the internship content and the maintenance of contact with the employers.


(8) The internship semester, including preparatory and review seminars, is valued at 30 credit points.


(9) No new graded or non-graded assessments can be undertaken during the internship semester. It is however possible
to retake up to 2 graded or non-graded assessments which were undertaken in previous semesters. Registration must
be carried out at latest one week before the start of the examination period, or, in the case of examinations set during
the semester, at latest one week before the examination in question.


**§ 3 a** **Exchange Semester**


(1) Furtwangen University actively encourages students to participate in an exchange semester. For this reason, in study
programmes where an exchange semester is not a mandatory part of the curriculum, it is specifically recommended
that an exchange semester abroad is taken in the sixth or seventh semester of the programme. Responsibility for the
organisation of the exchange semester lies with the student, if necessary, with the support of the faculty and the International Center.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 8/32


(2) An exchange semester cannot be taken later than the fourth semester of the study programme unless the foundation
studies have been successfully completed. Students who have only one outstanding credit requirement from the foundation studies, can apply to their dean for permission to participate in an exchange semester.


(3) In accordance with § 15.9, the Faculty Examination Board is responsible for accreditation of credits awarded for graded and non-graded courses taken abroad. The task can be delegated for example to an international coordinator, a regional coordinator or a dean of studies.


(4) A minimum of 16 credits for graded and non-graded assessments must be gained abroad. These must comply with the
qualification goals of the relevant study programme and are normally accredited within a “Study Abroad” module (SAM)
which replaces the normal sixth semester study module which would have been taken at Furtwangen University. The
prerequisite for this is an agreement between the student and the person responsible within the faculty for the organisation of exchange semesters.


(5) The SAM is worth 18, 24 or 30 credit points (of which a minimum of 2/3 are from graded assessments), and of which
up to 2 credit points (in a SAM with 18 credit points), 4 credit points (in a SAM with 24 credit points) or 6 credit points
(in a SAM with 30 credit points) can be gained by a faculty-defined non-graded assessment taken at Furtwangen University.


(6) For study programmes in which an exchange semester is a mandatory part of the curriculum, other regulations apply
which are laid down in the Specific Section of the Study and Examinations Regulations.


(7) During the semester abroad, graded or non-graded assessments will not be automatically registered. Graded or nongraded assessments which students must sit must be registered at latest one week before the start of the examination
period, or, in the case of examinations set during the semester, at latest one week before the examination in question.


**§ 3 b** **Bilingual Study Programmes**


In some study programmes it is possible to take a bilingual degree. Upon request, this will be indicated in the degree
certificate, as well as in a separate certificate.


Of the 210 ECTS credits of the relevant bachelor’s programme, more than 60 ECTS credits must be gained in both
English- and German-taught courses taken, taking into account any study or internship semester spent abroad. In addition, a level of C1 in the Common European Framework test of language proficiency must be achieved in the nonnative language(s). Successful completion of the necessary language test(s) must not result in an extension of the
study time, and therefore must be taken before the final examination necessary to complete the degree, i.e., generally
before submission of the thesis. Further details are listed in the Specific Section of the Study and Examinations Regulations, in the individual regulations of the study programmes in question.


**§ 3 c** **Special Regulations for the “StudyPlus” Programme Model during the Period of Contract between**
**Partner Companies and Students**


a. Students are required to carry out both the “internship semester” and their bachelor’s thesis at the partner

company.


b. Students are required to spend the time when they are not attending lectures or sitting examinations, or which

the student is entitled to take as holiday, at the partner company carrying out additional practical work. The
content of this additional practical work is to be mutually determined by the university and the partner company.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 9/32


**§ 4** **Structure of Examinations**


(1) For successful completion of studies, 210 credit points must be earned. Passed modules are awarded the number of
credit points laid down in the Specific Section. A total of 180 credit points must be earned to successfully complete the
Physiotherapy Plus degree progamme.


(2) The Foundation Studies encompass the first two semesters of taught content modules. From these, the final grade for
the Foundation Studies is calculated which is weighted as defined in § 27.1 and forms part of the final grades certificate. The final grades certificate contains the final grade for the Foundation Studies, the module grades of the Advanced Studies and the grade for the bachelor’s thesis. The Specific Section defines the individual graded and nongraded (pass/fail) assessments for modules, as well as the module grades for the Foundation Studies and Advanced
Studies. Graded assessments are normally examined in conjunction with the relevant course and are related to the
course content.


**§ 5** **Permanent Withdrawal from Programme and Loss of Right to Assessment, Deadlines**


(1) All Foundation Studies modules (60 credit points) must be successfully completed by the end of the second semester.
In the Physiotherapy Plus degree progamme, the performance assessments for the Advanced Studies (120 credit
points) should be completed by the end of the sixth semester. All Advanced Studies modules (150 credit points) must
be successfully completed by the end of the seventh semester. An accelerated track of studies enabling completion of
credit requirements prior to these deadlines is possible.


(2) The students will be informed of the number and type of graded and non-graded assessments required for the completion of a module on a timely basis. They will also be informed of the deadlines for such assessments as well as the assignment and submission dates for the bachelor’s thesis.


(3) The right to be assessed is forfeited and permanent withdrawal from the programme is required when the graded and
non-graded assessments for the Foundation Studies have not been successfully completed within two semesters of
the deadline defined in section (1). The same applies when the graded and non-graded assessments for the Advanced
Studies have not been successfully completed within three semesters of the deadline defined in section (1). Exception
to the above will only be made where the cause of the delay lies outside the student’s control. If the third or fourth curricular semester is an internship semester, this will not be included in the calculation of the time limit for the Foundation
Studies.


(4) Any student entitled to parental leave under the relevant current law (BEEG) is entitled to complete certain individual
graded or non-graded assessments at a point in time later than the deadline laid down in the examination regulations.


(5) Any student who is able to study but is unable to attend lectures or complete the required non-graded assessment due
to a longer illness or a longer or permanent disability, is entitled to complete individual graded or non-graded assessments at a point in time later than the deadline laid down in the examination regulations. The extension period can be
no more than three years. Section 24 (7) applies to the processing time for the bachelor's thesis. The student must
produce pertinent documentation, in most cases a doctor’s note. In case of doubt, the university can require the student to provide a doctor’s note from a doctor of the university’s choice. Students must inform the university immediately
of any changes in their circumstances.


(6) The regulations for the extension of deadlines as stated in Paragraph 5 above also apply to any student who is:


1. A member of the Students’ Parliament (Studierendenrat) and the Student Council (Allgemeinen Stud
ierendenausschuss AStA) in accordance with the founding statutes of the Student Parliament (Verfassten
Studierendenschaft).


2. A member of a German national olympic, scouting, reserve or team sports squad, or of a young hopefuls

squad 1 and 2, which belongs to a federal association of the German Olympic Sports Confederation.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 10/32


3. A member of a state sports squad, or any other athlete designated as an elite athlete on an individial basis by

the Elite Sports Officer of the University Board of Executives according to the current HFU list of criteria.


(7) If elite athletes end their sporting career during their academic studies, the Elite Sports Officer of the University Board
of Executives will decide at what point in time a further extension of the deadline will no longer be permitted.


(8) Any student entitled to caregiving leave, is entitled to complete certain individual graded or non-graded assessments at
a point in time later than the deadline laid down in the examination regulations.


**§ 6** **General Admission Requirements**


(1) The Foundation Studies and Advanced Studies can only be completed by someone who:


1. is enrolled for the university’s bachelor’s programme on the basis of the German university entrance qualifications, the _Zeugniss der allgemeinen Hochschulreife_, the _fachgebundenen Hochschulreife_ or the _Fachhochschul-_
_reife_ or on the basis of recognition by a legal regulation or the relevant state authority to be the equivalent of the
above


and


2. has successfully completed the graded and non-graded assessments for the relevant modules.


(2) Students must complete the graded and non-graded assessments which form part of a module during the curricular
semester specified in the Specific Section. The exception to this rule is the bachelor’s thesis, where the faculty’s own
rules and regulations apply. Enrolment for a curricular semester is also deemed to be enrolment for all graded and
non-graded assessments of this semester. Where the allocation of a lecture to a specific curricular semester is not
binding, the student must enrol for the lecture during the enrolment period.


Admission to a module examination can only be withheld where the requirements listed in section (1) are wholly or partially unfulfilled, or
the documentation is incomplete, or
the student has permanently failed to complete the Foundation Studies or Advanced Studies in the same or a similar
study programme, or
the person is currently appealing an examination result, or
the student has lost the right to be assessed in accordance with § 34.2 LHG, or
the student’s malus credits have reached or exceeded the permissible maximum.


(3) For admission to Advanced Studies, students must have earned a minimum of 54 credit points from the Foundation
Studies modules. Exceptions to this rule, up to a maximum of 16 credit points, can be made at the discretion of the
dean of studies. Where the first semester of the Advanced Studies is an internship semester, such internship may be
undertaken without admitting the student in question to the Advanced Studies. In such a case, if the conditions for admission to the Advanced Studies are not fulfilled by the end of the internship semester, the student is automatically enrolled in the second curricular semester. Students who are not admitted to the Advanced Studies may apply to the
dean of studies to be allowed to take modules worth up to 12 credit points from the first curricular semester of the Advanced Studies (usually from the 3rd curricular semester). In the case of degree programmes that begin annually, the
dean of studies may approve the bringing forward of more than 12 credit points at the student's request. These duties
of the Dean of Studies may be delegated to a designated office.


**§ 7** **Graded and non-graded assessment**


(1) The assessments will, as a rule, take place during the examination period outside the lecture period of a given semester.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 11/32


(2) Where an individual can prove satisfactorily that due to prolonged or permanent impairment in accordance with § 32,
(4) (5) of the LHG, they are unable to complete the exam in whole or in part in the prescribed manner, the Faculty Examination Board in question will allow suitable measures to be taken to compensate for the impairment. A medical or
psychological certificate is required for this purpose.


(3) For each student enrolled for examinations, the Examination Office will set up an account to record bonus points for all
passed modules and malus points for all failed modules. There are separate accounts for the Foundation Studies and
Advanced Studies.


(4) Where a module is passed, its credit points are credited to the applicable bonus account. Where a graded or nongraded assessment is failed, its credit points are recorded in the applicable malus account. The bonus account shows
a student’s progress in their studies, while the malus account reflects all failed assessments.


(5) The language of instruction in the courses is usually German and/or English. Examinations are usually held in the
language in which the course of the module to be examined was held. The concrete specification is made in the module description. The examiner announces the language and examination modalities at the beginning of the semester.


(6) It must be possible to establish the identity of the person to be examined.


**§ 8** **Oral Examinations**


(1) As a rule, all oral examinations will be taken by at least two examiners (viva voce examination) or an examiner in the
presence of an observer. (§ 16). They can be held as group or individual examinations. The grade is the average of the
individual grades awarded by the examinors.


(2) The duration of an oral exam for each person to be examined is at least 15 minutes but no more than 30 minutes.


(3) The main content matter and the results must be recorded in written form. The result should be communicated to the
person examined at the end of the oral examination.


(4) Any student wishing to take the same examination at a later point in time is permitted to view the examination if space
allows and if the examinee is in agreement. Student observers are not permitted to be present when feedback and examination results are being given.

the examination may also be conducted using electronic information and communication systems (online).


**§ 9** **Written Examinations and Other Written Assignments**


(1) In written examinations and other written assignments students should demonstrate that they are capable of solving
problems and completing tasks using the standard methods of their subject, within a limited time frame and with limited
access to resources. The examination also seeks to determine whether students possess the requisite basic
knowledge. An examination may offer a choice of different topics.


(2) The grading period should not exceed four weeks.


(3) The duration of a written exam is 90 minutes. Any exceptions are laid down in the Specific Section.


(4) Written examinations may be conducted entirely or in part, by means of multiple-choice questions.

**§ 10** **Grading**


(1) Assessments can be a non-graded assessment, a graded assessment or a combination of the two. Non-graded assessments are awarded a pass or fail. Graded assessments are awarded a grade.


(2) The grades for the different graded assessments are set by the examiner in question. The following grades are to be
used when marking graded assessments:


1; 1.3 = very good = outstanding performance


1.7; 2; 2.3 = good = performance which is significantly above average


2.7; 3; 3.3 = satisfactory = average performance


3.7; 4 = adequate = performance which, despite shortcomings still satisfies requirements


5 = inadequate = performance which, due to significant shortcomings, no longer satisfies
requirements


(3) Where a graded assessment is made up of several parts with individual grades, the overall grade is calculated as an
average of the appropriately weighted individual grades.


(4) The module grade is as follows:


for an average of up to and including 1.5 = very good


for an average of between 1.6 and up to and including 2.5 = good


for an average of between 2.6 and up to and including 3.5 = satisfactory


for an average of between 3.6 and up to and including 4.0 = adequate


anything below an average of 4.1 = inadequate (graded as 5.0)


(5) When calculating the final grade (§§ 20 and 27), section 4 applies in the same manner.


(6) In calculating the average, the grade is rounded only to the first decimal place; all other decimals are ignored without
rounding.


(7) Grades achieved under these Study and Examination Regulations are converted to the ECTS grading system in accordance with the following table (due to the limited amount of data available, a conversion on the basis of statistical
data is not possible).


German Grade ECTS Grade


1.0 - 1.5 A


1.6 - 2.3 B


2.4 - 3.0 C


3.1 - 3.7 D


3.8 - 4.0 E


4.1 - 5.0 F


(8) The grades for assignments taken during the study semester abroad are converted using the “Standard HFU Table for
the Calculation of Grades Earned Abroad” (Tabelle für die HFU-einheitliche Umrechnung von Auslandsprüfungsleistungen).


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 13/32


(9) The module grade is calculated as follows: the grades of each of the module’s graded assessments are multiplied by
the appropriate credit points. The results are then added and divided by the total number of credits of all the module
assessments. The result is rounded to the first decimal point.


**§ 11** **Unexcused Absence, Withdrawal, Deception, Breach of Regulation**


(1) Absence or withdrawal from an examination without good reason will be awarded a grade of 5.0. The same applies
where a written assessment is not completed within the required time period. Students may withdraw once from an examination for which they are registered without being required to give a reason. To do so an application must be filed
with the Examinations Office in writing no later than one day prior to the examination (if an assessment consists of
several parts, before the final part).


Multiple withdrawals from an examination are permitted for any student who is:


1. A member of the Students’ Parliament (Studierendenrat) and the Student Council (Allgemeinen Stud
ierendenausschuss AStA) in accordance with the founding statutes of the Student Parliament (Verfassten
Studierendenschaft).


2. A member of a German national olympic, scouting, reserve or team sports squad, or of a young hopefuls

squad 1 and 2, which belongs to a federal association of the German Olympic Sports Confederation.


3. A member of a state sports squad, or any other athlete designated by the Elite Sports Officer of the University

Board of Executives as an elite athlete on an individual basis, according to the current HFU list of criteria.


If elite athletes end their sporting career during their academic studies, the Elite Sports Officer of the University Board
of Executives will decide at what point in time a further extension of the deadline will no longer be permitted.


(2) A credible reason for absence or withdrawal must be submitted promptly and in writing. In case of illness, a doctor's
note, and in case of doubt, a note from a doctor nominated by the university may be required. Where the reason given
is deemed valid, a new examination date will be set.


(3) The illness of a child for which the student is the legal guardian is assigned the same status as the student's own illness in the case of observance of deadlines for initial examination registration, examination resits and reasons for absence from examinations / graded assessments.


(4) Where a student attempts to influence the result of an examination through deception or the use of non-admissible
aids, the examination will be awarded the grade of 5.0. Any person disrupting the proper course of an examination may
be excluded by the examiner responsible. In such a case, the assessment will be awarded the grade of 5.0. In serious
cases of disturbance or deception, the Faculty Examination Board can request that the university exclude such a person from taking part in any further examinations. Plagiarism is considered a serious offense.


(5) In addition to the measures mentioned in Paragraph 4, the Faculty Examination Board may apply to the Vice-President
for Academics and Diversity to exclude the person being examined from taking any further examinations.


**§ 12** **Pass and Fail**


(1) All module assessments must be passed to successfully complete the module.


(2) An assessment in the form of a graded assessment has been passed when a minimum grade of 4.0 has been awarded. Any further assessment requirements imposed should be marked as a footnote in the Specific Section of the General Study and Examination Regulations.


(3) An assessment in the form of a non-graded assessment has been passed when a “pass” has been awarded.


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 14/32


(4) An assessment which is a combination of graded assessment and non-graded assessment has been passed when a
minimum grade of 4.0 has been awarded in the graded assessment and a “pass” has been awarded in the non-graded
assessment. Any further assessment requirements should be marked as a footnote in the Specific Section of the General Study and Examination Regulations. In such a case, registration or withdrawal is only possible for the assessment
as a whole, not from the individual parts of the assessment.


(5) The Foundation Studies have been passed once all Foundation Studies modules have been passed. The Advanced
Studies has been passed once the internship semester, all Advanced Studies modules and the bachelor’s thesis have
all been passed with a minimum grade of 4.0.


(6) If a module has not been passed or the bachelor’s thesis was awarded a grade of less than 4.0, this should be communicated to the student being examined. If applicable, the student must also be informed as to whether and, if applicable, to what extent and within which deadlines, the assessment in question / the bachelor’s thesis can be retaken.


(7) If the Foundation Studies or Advanced Studies have been failed, upon provision of the relevant documents and the
notice of exmatriculation, the student can apply for a certificate showing the graded and non-graded assessments
passed and the relevant grades. The certificate will also show that the Foundation Studies / Advanced Studies were
not passed.


**§ 13** **Resit Examinations**


(1) Examinations which have already been passed cannot be retaken.


(2) Examinations which have not been passed must be retaken. Failed examinations are awarded the number of malus
points laid out in the Specific Section.


(3) The resit examination shall be taken at the earliest at the beginning of and at the latest within the examination period of
the respective following semester. Resit examinations must be offered every semester even in courses offered annually. Exceptions must be justified to the dean of studies. These duties of the Dean of Studies may be delegated to a designated office.

**§ 14** **Accreditation of Study Periods, Accreditation of Prior Learning**
**Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning**


(1) Credits and degrees which have been awarded at other German state and state-recognised universities and Cooperative State Universities, or from degree programmes in foreign state or state-recognised universities, will be accredited,
upon request, on the condition that there is no significant difference between such awards and the awards which they
are to substitute. The onus is on the university to prove that an application does not fulfill the requirements for accreditation.


In the case of a change of degree within Furtwangen University, passed assessments and failed examination attempts
in courses which are common to both degree programmes will be officially accredited after a hearing of the party involved.


(2) Prior experiential learning will be accredited upon application if the knowledge and skills derived from the experience
are equivalent in terms of content and level to the coursework and examinations they are intended to replace. The
onus is on the applicant to prove that their application fulfills the requirements for accreditation. The volume of credit
permissible from prior experiential learning should not exceed 50% of the total degree award.


(3) Recognition cannot be given as a substitute for coursework and examinations which the student has already passed or
failed at Furtwangen University or from which they have already withdrawn. The application for recognition must be
submitted to the Chair of the Faculty Examination Board/Dean of Studies of the relevant faculty within three weeks of
the start of lectures in a semester. Thereafter, a claim for recognition only exists if the requirements for reinstatement
of the previous status are met (§ 32 LVwVfG). It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide the necessary information about the assessment to be recognised. In the case of certificates or documents that are not issued in German
or English, the submission of a certified German translation may be requested. The documents to be submitted include
in particular


         - accreditation in accordance with Paragraph 1: unadjusted transcript of records, module description with learning objectives, methods of teaching, content, workload, prerequisites and grading system used to assess the
module.


         - accreditation in accordance with Paragraph 2: vocational training regulations, general examination regulations, assessment tasks.


The final decision regarding accreditation must be made by the end of the enrolment period of the semester in which
the completed application was made to the Faculty Examination Board/dean of studies. Where accreditation is refused
or only partially granted, the rationale for the decision must be set out in writing and include information regarding appeal procedures. These duties of the Dean of Studies may be delegated to a designated office.


(4) Should existing bilateral agreements between Germany and other countries pertaining to equivalency in universities
vary from sections 1 to 3 in favour of foreign university students, the regulations of these equivalency agreements take
precedence.


(5) Grades for accredited graded or non-graded assessments will be carried forward directly to the students record, where
the grading system is comparable, or where possible, be calculated according to the table in § 10.7, and will contribute
to the total grade. In the case of ungraded credits for examinations or modules for which the General Study and Examination Regulations require a grade, a grade of 4.0 will be awarded. Accredited non-graded assessments and graded
assessments can be clearly marked in the grades certificate. Credit points for the accredited modules will be awarded
to the bonus account and any failed graded or non-graded assessments will be listed in the malus account.


(6) Foundation studies can be recognised in related degree programmes after examination by the Dean of Studies


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 16/32

In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 19/32


**Part III:**


**Advanced Studies (Semesters 3 - 7)**


**§ 22** **Completion of Studies**


(1) Completion of the Advanced Studies marks the successful completion of a bachelor’s degree. The Specific Section
defines which mandatory and elective assessments must be completed.


(2) Advanced Studies assessments will normally be completed concurrently with the studies (§ 4.2), following the relevant
taught courses.


**§ 23** **Permanent Failure to Complete Studies**


A student has permanently failed to complete the Advanced Studies, if


1. the bachelor’s thesis has not been passed at the second attempt or is considered failed, or


2. the number of malus points from Advanced Studies assessments exceeds 96 credit points, or


3. a deadline was exceeded (cf. § 5.3).


In all three cases the student loses the right to be examined for the degree programme in question and will be
exmatriculated.


**§ 24** **Registration, Assignment and Time Limit for Completion of the Bachelor’s Thesis**


(1) The bachelor’s thesis is a graded assessment the aim of which is to show that a student is able to independently complete an assigned task related to their subject area within a limited timeframe using sound scientific methodology. The
topic of the bachelor’s thesis is to be issued only after completion of the foundation studies, at earliest after the fifth – in
Physiotherapy Plus after the fourth – curricular semester and at latest three months after completion of all other course
assessments.


(2) The registration of the bachelor's thesis takes place within the registration period. The registration must include the
topic, name of primary supervisor, name of secondary supervisor (if known) and start and submission date of the thesis. The document must be signed by the candidate and the primary supervisor/university supervisor. A starting date
other than 01 March or 01 September must be approved by the Faculty Examination Board. A charge is payable for
late registration. Faculties can set an alternative deadline in their Thesis Stipulations.


(3) Having checked and confirmed the registration using the full particulars provided above (see Paragraph 2), the Faculty
Examination Board will assign the bachelor’s theses. Topic and deadlines must be recorded on the file. If a bachelor’s
thesis has not been registered or does not fulfil the registration requirements defined by the individual faculties in their
Thesis Stipulations, the bachelor’s thesis cannot be undertaken or will not be recognised.


(4) The Bachelor’s thesis will be assigned and supervised by a professor or a member of the academic staff or, if such are
not available as examiners, by a tenured or non-tenured lecturer (primary supervisor). The secondary thesis supervisor
may also be a person with practical and training experience. Both supervisors must have gained an equivalent or higher degree in the same degree programme, or an equivalent qualification. The consent of the chairperson of the Faculty
Examination Board is required if the bachelor’s thesis is to be undertaken in an establishment outside the university.


(5) Bachelor’s thesis topics will be announced by the primary supervisors in the faculty or by companies. Candidates may
approach primary supervisors in the faculty with their own proposals; topics from other faculties may also be undertaken. The Faculty Examination Board will decide on the assignment of topics and the allocation of supervisors to the in

In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 20/32


dividual topics or candidates. Topic, remit and scope of the bachelor’s thesis are to be defined by the supervisor in a
manner which ensures that the time limit for the bachelor’s thesis can be adhered to. The bachelor’s thesis can also be
undertaken as group work, provided that individual contributions which are to be graded can be clearly distinguished
and assessed.


(6) An application for a subsequent change of topic must be submitted to the dean of studies on prior arrangement with
the thesis supervisor and the Departmental Office must be notified. If the change merely involves the final wording of a
provisional thesis topic, it is sufficient for the primary thesis supervisor to make a corresponding insertion on the thesis
registration form.


(7) The time limit for completion of the bachelor’s thesis is four months.


1. If necessary to ensure equal examination conditions, or in cases where the candidate is not responsible for the
delay, the processing time may be extended to a maximum of six months; the final decision on this shall be made
by the dean of studies on the basis of a statement by the supervisor. These duties of the Dean of Studies may be
delegated to a designated office.


2. The candidate must immediately apply to the Head of the Examination Office for an interruption of the bachelor's
thesis due to illness or other reasons beyond their control, stating and providing evidence of the reasons. The interruption may not exceed a total of two months; in the event of a longer interruption, withdrawal may be approved by the Head of the Examination Office.


(8) Withdrawal in accordance with § 11.1, after a bachelor’s thesis has been registered, is only possible under exceptional
circumstances and is subject to the approval of the Faculty Examination Board, in cases of Paragraph 7 (2), by the
Head of the Examination Office. In such cases, a new thesis topic must be applied for within two months of the withdrawal date. In exceptional cases, the final decision will be taken by the Head of the Examinations Office.


**§ 25** **Submission and Assessment of the Bachelor’s Thesis**


(1) The final papers shall be submitted in electronic form at the specified time. The time of submission is to be made part
of the records. The supervisors may request additional print copies, which may not deviate from the electronic form.
The details for the submission of theses are regulated by the Faculty Examination Board in their "Thesis Stipulations”.


(2) When submitting the thesis, a written assurance must be given that the thesis – in the case of a group thesis, the part
of the thesis marked accordingly – has been written independently and that no sources and aids other than those
specified have been used. This assurance must be signed by the student's own hand, which can also be transmitted
digitally.


(3) The bachelor’s thesis is assessed by two examiners (primary and secondary supervisors). The assessment should be
completed within six weeks. Upon request, three weeks after the submission of the thesis, the primary supervisor can
inform the Examinations Office whether or not the thesis has been passed.


(4) The thesis grade is the arithmetical average of the grades awarded by the two examiners. It forms part of the final
grade, weighted as defined in the Specific Section of the SPO. If the grades of the two examiners diverge by more than
2.0, or if only one of the examiners awards the thesis a grade of 5.0 (fail), the two examiners will be asked to give their
rationale for the grades awarded. The Faculty Examination Board will then decide whether a third review should be
undertaken by a professor of Furtwangen University. If two of the three markers award the thesis a grade of 5.0 (Fail),
the thesis has been failed. However, if at least two of the examinors award the thesis a grade of 4.0, the grade of the
bachelor’s thesis will be the arithmetical average of the grades awarded by the three examinors. If in doing so, this results in an arithmetical average of less than 4.0 (adequate), the bachelor’s thesis will be awarded a 4.0.


(5) In cases where a candidate who is employed externally agrees to an obligation of confidentiality, the thesis is assessed only on the basis of the documentation submitted; it may not contain any confidential sections. The documentation may contain a non-disclosure notice effective for a maximum of five years. This must, however, be explicitly


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 21/32


agreed prior to assignment of the thesis by the primary and secondary supervisors of the thesis. Such an agreement
should be signed by the dean of the faculty and the university supervisor.


(6) A bachelor’s thesis that is discontinued or not submitted on time will be graded as a “Fail” (5.0).


(7) If a bachelor’s thesis receives a grade of less than 4.0, it may be retaken once; a second resit is not possible. Application for the setting of a new topic must be made in writing to the chairperson of the Faculty Examination Board no later
than two months following the notification of failure. Failure to comply with this deadline will result in loss of entitlement
to be examined except in cases where the candidate was not responsible for the delay. In exceptional cases, the final
decision will be taken by the Head of the Examinations Office.


(8) The thesis module includes a colloquium or a presentation. Further details can be set out in the thesis stipulations of
the individual faculties.


(9) The Faculty Examination Board decide upon faculty-specific thesis stipulations which affect, for example, the acceptance stipulations, the presentation, the costs, the place of work, external theses, the formal layout and design, and
the data storage devices which are to be submitted.

**§ 26** **Additional Modules / Subjects and Required Elective Subjects**


(1) Students may be examined in subjects / modules in addition to those prescribed (additional subjects).


(2) The status of additional subjects cannot be changed to that of required elective subject. A graded additional subject
may be listed on the grades certificate upon request. Additional subjects do not affect the student´s final grade.


(3) Required elective courses become mandatory examined courses upon registration for the class which means that they
must also be passed even if they are not a requirement of the bachelor’s degree. Withdrawal from an elective is in
principle not permitted. If the course is no longer offered, the dean of studies will assign a new required elective course as a substitute. The Head of the Examinations Office will make decisions regarding any other exceptions in special cases upon request.


**§ 27** **Composition of Final Grade and Grades Certificate (Zeugnis)**


(1) In accordance with § 10.4-6, the final grade is calculated by taking the final grade from the Foundation Studies
weighted with half its credit points, and the graded Advanced Studies modules weighted in full.


(2) For outstanding results (final grade of 1.3 or above) the grade "Passed with Distinction" is awarded.


(3) A certificate confirming successful completion of studies shall be issued within four weeks if possible. The overall
grade of the Foundation Studies (§ 20), the modules of the Advanced Studies, the topic and grade of the bachelor’s
thesis, as well as the overall grade are to be included in the certificate; the grades will include the decimal value in
brackets as set out in § 10.6. Furthermore, the total number of credit points, the confirmation of the internship semester
and any period of study abroad, the area of specialisation, as well as, upon request, the results of the examinations in
any additional subjects, the length of time required to successfully complete the degree, and, if applicable, bilingual
study, shall be included in the certificate.


(4) The certificate bears the date of the day on which the final examination was completed. It is signed by the Deputy
President or, in exceptional cases, by the Vice-President for Learning and Diversity and by the relevant dean or, in exceptional cases, by the Vice-Dean for Academics, and bears the seal of Furtwangen University - Information Technology, Engineering, Business, Media, Health Sciences

**§ 29** **Invalid Graded / Non-Graded Assessments of Foundation Level Studies and / or Advanced Level Studies**


(1) Where the examinee is found guilty of deception on a graded / non-graded assessment and such fact only becomes
known after the grades certificate was issued, the relevant grade can be corrected in accordance with § 11.4. If necessary, modules can be awarded a 5.0 and the Foundation Studies or Advanced Studies can be declared failed. The
same applies to the bachelor‘s thesis.


(2) Where the requirements for the completion of a module have not been met, but no deception was intended by the
examinee and this fact only becomes known after the grades certificate was issued, then no further action will be taken. In cases where intentional deception was used to pass a graded / non-graded assessment or a module, such a
graded / non-graded assessment or module can be awarded a 5.0 and the Foundation Studies and Advanced Studies
can be declared failed.


(3) Before a decision is made, an opportunity for a hearing must be given. The decision is taken by the relevant Faculty
Examination Board in accordance with Paragraphs 1 and 2.


(4) The incorrect grades certificate must be retracted and, if applicable, a replacement must be issued. Should a graded /
non-graded assessment or the degree programme as a whole be declared failed as a result of deception, the bachelor’s degree certificate must be revoked together with the incorrect grades certificate. A decision made on the basis of
Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2, Sentence 2 is only possible within five years of the date of issue of the grades certificate.


**§ 30** **Inspection of Examination Records**


Within one year of completing the examination, the examinee will be granted access to his/her written examination papers, the related reports and the examination records, usually on the premises of the university, upon request and within a reasonable period of time; § 29 of the State Administrative Procedure Act (Landesverwaltungsverfahrensgesetzes)
remains unaffected.


**§ 31** **Leave of Absence**


(1) Students on leave of absence may not take part in any examination procedures. An exception applies to students
on maternity leave in accordance with § 61 para. 3 LHG.
(2) Final theses that were started in a previous semester and can be submitted in the following semester by extending
the processing time can be completed, submitted and presented.

**§ 31 a Maternity Rights, Parental Leave, Caregiving**


(1) If maternity rights are applied for in accordance with the law for the protection of working mothers (“Mutterschutzgesetz”, MuSchG), applicable deadlines must be adhered to and pertinent documentation must be enclosed with the application. Deadlines for maternity rights take precedence over any other deadlines in the Study and Examination Regulations. The period of maternity leave is not included in the deadline applicable in § 5.3.


(2) Mothers-to-be are permitted to take examinations during maternity leave, however the Examinations Office must be
informed of this in writing. This regulation is valid for the entire semester if a part of the maternity leave takes place
during the semester.


(3) Similarly, if parental leave is applied for in accordance with current German regulations (BEEG), the applicable deadlines must be adhered to. Students applying for parental leave must notify the faculty examination board in writing of
the time period requested, at least four weeks prior to the start of the parental leave. Pertinent documentation should


In force since: 26.06.2025 (Status: 25.06.2025, Last updated: 13.08.2025) 24/32


be enclosed with the application. The dean of studies will ascertain whether the applicant fulfils the legal requirements
for parental leave and will inform the applicant of the results and of the new examination dates.


(4) If maternity or parental leave take place during study leave, it is still possible to take examinations. (See § 61.3, LGG).
A separate exam registration must be carried out by the required deadline. Recognition of exam results without prior
registration is not possible.


(5) Caregiving leave for a close relative as set out under the relevant current Caregiving Leave Law and §§ 14 and 15 of
the eleventh book of the Social Welfare Statutes can be granted upon request. Pertinent documentation should be enclosed with the application. The period of caregiving leave is not taken into consideration in the deadline set down in
§ 5.3.
