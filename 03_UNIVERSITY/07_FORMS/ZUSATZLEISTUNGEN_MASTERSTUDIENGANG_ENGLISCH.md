**By enrolling for module components as part of your foundation course, these turn into mandatory subjects for**
**purposes of examination regulations. This means that all such module components have to be passed.**


**Module Components as Part of a Foundation Course for Master Programmes**
Applicants whose relevant skills / knowledge is not sufficient (e.g. with less than 210 credits or lacking specialisation) may
yet be granted a conditional admission provided they can obtain the skills / knowledge they lack during their studies or as
part of a foundation course. This can be achieved by enrolling for mandatory or elective module components of other study
programmes.

Module components forming part of the foundation course have to be submitted to the examination office on the „Antrag auf
Anrechnung“(application for credit) form. They also have to be noted in the table below (cf. § 13 im Allgemeinen Teil der SPO
für Masterstudiengänge (general study and examination regulations for master programmes). Additionally, if you wish to take
mandatory components ahead of time, this has to be approved by the dean of studies. For both of these, this completed form
serves as application form.
