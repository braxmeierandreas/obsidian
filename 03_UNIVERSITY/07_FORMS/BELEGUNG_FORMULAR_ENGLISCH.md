**Registrations made as stated in this form are legally binding.**
**It is up to you to check the examination office’s registrations for you in Studi-Portal. This can be done within a few days of the end**
**of the registrations period / submission of this form.**


**1. Subjects taken ahead of schedule and compulsory electives**
When you register for a compulsory elective, it becomes a compulsory subject for examination regulation purposes, e.g. they have to be
passed.

Where the examination in question can’t be offered in the next semester (or the next possible semester), you will have to re-register for a
substitute course as determined by the dean of studies. This will apply even if the course in question is not required for graduation.
Compulsory electives can be changed into additional subjects only after they have been passed. A non-graded assessment ( _Studienleistung_ )
cannot be changed into a graded assessment ( _Prüfungsleistung)_ ; once you have passed, the opposite (graded to non-graded) is possible.

**Prior to submitting the registration, the dean of studies has to approve:**

- subjects taken ahead of schedule

- compulsory electives which cannot normally count towards your degrees credits (check with your faculty)

- compulsory electives which can count towards your credits as an exception for a study semester abroad (please note under “comment”)

- substitute subjects (please state in “comment” which subject is being substituted)

will not count towards your overall grade.
