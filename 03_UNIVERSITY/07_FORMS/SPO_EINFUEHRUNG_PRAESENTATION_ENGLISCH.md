**1**


# **SPO* General**


- The **SPO (Study and Examination Regulations)** can be found on the HFU INTRA
→ this document governs your entire studies and is thus the **most important** document for the
time of your study **.**
**Please note** : there is an English version of the SPO for your convenience, but only the
GERMAN VERSION is LEGALLY BINDING


- **General Section**

  - exams: passing, failing, re-examinationl

  - loss of admission to study programme

  - grades certificate, academic title …


- **Special Section**

  - organisation of semester, curriculum, subjects, exam types,

  - graded / non-graded work, credits…






# **SPO General Part: Bonus-Malus-System**


- If you _pass a module_ you will receive **bonus points** (= module credits)
→ in accordance with the ECTS for a given module


- If you _fail any graded or non-graded work_ you will receive **malus points**
(→also applies to unexcused absence)


- **De-registration/Withdrawal** is possible for any exam on the **first attempt only**
→ An request for deregristration has to be submitted to the examination office **in writing no**
**later than the day prior to the exam**   - (Dangers: BAföG and exceeding time limits)
→will avoid malus points


- **Medical certificate** for exams that you have not taken due to illness must be submitted to the
Examinations Office **without delay**
→will avoid malus points






# **SPO General Part: Malus Points**


- You can withdraw from a course when you first register. Withdrawal must be notified to the
examination office in writing no later than the day before the examination.


- Members of the Student Council/AStA, students on maternity or parental leave or care may
withdraw several times (Evidence is required here)


- If you accumulate 24 malus points (during Undergraduate Studies/Grundstudium*):
→ Consultation/Advice meeting with the Dean of Studies


- Once you accumulate 49 malus points during the Undergraduate Studies
you will automatically be deregistered and exmatriculated (§21)






# **SPO General Part: Time Limits**


- If you are **un** able to complete your Undergraduate Studies (all modules the SPO lists
for the first two curriculum semesters) within four study semesters, you will be automatically
deregistered and exmatriculated (§5 Abs. 3)


- **Exception:** If the need for extra time was caused by factors outside of your control
→ File a formal objection against deregistration (= exmatriculation) citing these factors.
Possible reason: Illness documented by medical certificate („on / off“ medical certificates for
each specific exam is not considered relevant!)


- Indications that the failure was **in your control** after all, would be: Voluntary de-registration from
or repeated non-attendance without excuse and repeated failure of exams


 **Cheating** or use of non-permitted aides during exams will result in a „fail (5,0)“ grade (§11 (4)).


# **SPO General Part: Admission to Hauptstudium***


- Automatic admission with at least 54 bonus points


- If you have at least 44 bonus points (and up to 53) you can apply to the dean of studies for
admission to Haupstudium


- Without such admission, you can submit an application to the Dean of Studies to take modules
from the first semester of the main study program (up to 12 credit points) in advance.


- Completing modules from the undergraduate program must have the highest priority.
Please note: After four semesters of study, **all** modules from the “Grundstudium” must be
successfully completed.
