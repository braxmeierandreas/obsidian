_Recognition of Graded and Non-Graded Assessments / Recognition of_
_Professional Skills & Knowledge_

### **General**

If you have already completed graded assessments at another university, then such
assessments may, under certain circumstances, be recognized towards your studies at
Furtwangen University (HFU). The same applies for professional experience and skills.
Furtwangen University’s Study and Examination Regulations govern such recognition in
paragraph 14 for the bachelor programmes and in paragraph 13 for the master
programmes.

Please note:

  - **Neither graded nor non-grades assessments which you have already passed**

**or failed at Furtwangen University or from which you have withdrawn at HFU,**
**cannot be made up by a recognition.**


  - **Assessments taken at school cannot normally be recognized.**

This documents does **not** deal with assessments taken during a study semester abroad
which was undertaken as part of a Furtwangen University study programme.

### **Advice**

Please seek advice on the procedure and the possibilities of recognition prior to
submitting an application. Normally, the **Head of the Faculty Examination Board** (FPA) is
responsible for recognition issues. Some faculties delegate this function to the dean of
studies for the study programme in question.

### **Application for Recognition: Procedure and Deadlines**

An application for the recognition of performance assessments for any given
semester (or, in the case of advanced entry students, the previous semester) can
only be filed **within the first three weeks of the lecture period** .

**Please ensure that the Head of the FPA / Dean of Studies confirms the date of**
**application on the application form.**

Following this, approach the teaching staff / staff responsible for the module(s) in
question to get the recognition endorsement. To this end you have to make available all
relevant information regarding the work to be recognized. Where certificates or
documents are not originally in German or English, we reserve the right to require a
certified translation. The documents which need to be submitted are, in particular:

  - **Recognition of Graded and Non-Graded Assessments** : an unadjusted transcript

of records, module descriptions including learning outcomes, teaching methods,
content, workload and prerequisites, as well as the grading system used.

  - **Recognition of Professional Skills and Knowledge** : regulations regarding the

professional training, general examination regulations, assessment tasks


**Your application can only be processed, if you provide all documents necessary for**
**its assessment.**

Once you have obtained the assessment from all teaching staff / staff responsible for
the module(s) in question, submit the application to the **Head of the FPA / Dean of**
**Studies who** will decide on the recognition.

The Head of the FPA / Dean of Studies will provide you with a written notice on the
outcome of your application. The Head of the FPA / dean of studies will forward this
notice to the Examination Office.

### **Grades, Recognition of Failed Attempts**

Where ungraded work is recognized in place of work for which HFU’s Study and
Examination Regulations require a grade, such grade is assumed as **grade 4,0** .

Grades of recognized work will remain the same. Where recognized graded work has
been completed abroad, the computation of grades will take place in accordance with the
“Tabelle für die HFU-einheitliche Umrechnung von Auslandsprüfungsleistungen” (table
for the HFU-wide uniform conversion of graded work completed abroad).

If you have passed a graded or non-graded assessment following one or more failed
attempts, then the resulting **penalty points** (Maluspunkte) will be added to your account.

Recognized graded or non-graded assessments may be marked in the certificate.
