## Steps:

1.  **Duplicate this folder:** When starting a new assignment, copy the entire `Assignment_Template` folder.
2.  **Rename the duplicated folder:** Change the name to reflect your assignment (e.g., `AGF2_Essay_Topic`).
3.  **Fill in `00_Assignment_Brief.md`:** Start by detailing the assignment requirements, due dates, and any specific instructions.
4.  **Utilize other files/folders:**
    *   `01_Research_Notes.md`: For all your research, brainstorming, and initial ideas.
    *   `02_Drafts/`: Save different versions of your drafts here. It's good practice to date them (e.g., `Draft_2025-12-22.md`).
    *   `03_Final_Submission/`: Place your completed and polished assignment here.
    *   `04_Resources/`: Store any supporting documents like PDFs, images, datasets, or web links relevant to your assignment.
    *   `_Assignment_Checklist.md`: Use this to track your progress and ensure you don't miss any steps. Customize it for each assignment!
