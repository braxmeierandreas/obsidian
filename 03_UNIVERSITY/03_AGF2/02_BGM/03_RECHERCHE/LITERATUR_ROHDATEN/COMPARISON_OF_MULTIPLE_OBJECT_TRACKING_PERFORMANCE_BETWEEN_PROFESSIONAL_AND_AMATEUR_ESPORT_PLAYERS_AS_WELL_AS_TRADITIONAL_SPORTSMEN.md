**ABSTRACT**

High performance in multiple object tracking paradigms is associated with well-trained visuo-spatial
abilities, visual memory, and divided attention. These abilities are essential for both traditional sport
and eSport. The present study compared the tracking performance of professional as well as amateur
eSport players and traditional sportsmen. Professional eSport players outperformed amateurs, while no
other group differences were found. Positive association of eSport playtime and tracking performance
as well as elevated tracking scores of the entire study cohort compared to normal population indicate
a connection of eSport and sport activity and tracking performance.

**INTRODUCTION**

Electronic Sport (esport) is a widespread and increasingly growing economic, cultural, and scientific
phenomenon. With an audience up to 495 million (Newzoo, 2020) and an expanding player base of
both casual and professional players, the competition for immense prize pools on the top level is getting
more and more intense. The competition in esports takes place on different levels. Amateurs on the
lowest level compete in tournaments for fun and without any monetary motivation, while professional
players earn a relevant amount of income by playing, either alone or in teams. The main distinction
between amateurs and professionals in esport is not clearly or officially defined, mostly it is based
on the presence of relevant income (Lipovaya et al., 2018) earned by competition in tournaments.
This classification is applied identically in many traditional sports, such as soccer or tennis, where
players are defined as professionals if they are above a certain income limit or play in a certain

division. The practice of sport (or esport) of professionals is therefore their profession. The current
route to excellence in esport is still unclear (Pedraza-Ramirez et al., 2020), there are no developmental
stages defined and no real career plans are established (Abbot & Collins, 2004). Currently only some
thousand players can be accounted as professional in the esport context (Nielsen & Karhulahti 2017).
Players compete in diverse fields including, real time strategy games, e.g., _StarCraft II_ (Blizzard
Entertainment, 2010). or _Age of Empires III_ (Ensemble Studious, 2005), multiplayer online battle
arena games, e.g., _Defence of the Ancients 2_ (Valve Corporation, 2013) or _League of Legends_ (Riot
Games, 2009) or first-person shooters, e.g., _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare_ (Infinity Ward, 2019) or
_Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_ (Valve Corporation, 2012). Other competitive games and simulations
are based on traditional sports such as soccer, e.g., _FIFA 19_ = Fédération Internationale de Football
Association (EA Vancouver, 2018) or _PES 20_ = Pro Evolution Soccer (PES Productions, 2019) or
racing, e.g., _Gran Turismo Sport_ (Polyphony Digital, 2017) or _Forza Motorsport 4_ (Turn 10 Studios,
2011) (Bányai et al., 2019; Taylor, 2011).
All kinds of esport games require the player to react as fast as possible to versatile, primarily visual
stimuli, to make quick as well as correct decisions in complex situations, and to inhibit unnecessary
information along the way (Kowal et al., 2018). This is in line with the thoughts of Happonen and
Minashkina (2019) as well as Himmelstein et al. (2017), who propose that quick decision-making,
along with other mental factors, might be important to achieve victory. Accurate perception and
tracking of movement are fundamental. For instance, players need to track their own moving avatar
in League of Legends while simultaneously paying attention to the changing positions of multiple
enemies and allies. Another example is the football simulation FIFA. Similar to real-world football,
players need to keep focus on the ball-carrying avatar, opponents, and possible support avatars of
their own team. This is particularly difficult, because all of these related possible focus points are
in motion. This puts high demands on perceptual processing and central and peripheral attentional
skills (Bavelier et al., 2011; Torner et al., 2019).
An essential ability to succeed in those situations has been given the name “multiple object
tracking” (MOT) in the literature. MOT has been the subject of research for more than 30 years, first
addressed by Pylyshyn and Storm (1988). Subjects in their experiment were able to track up to 4-5
moving objects in a confined space, bouncing off each other and the borders. The authors deduced that
participants could not only use eye movements to follow the objects, but also an attentional locus that
is independent of those movements. As a result of this finding, several models (grouping, attention
switching, multifocal attention, preattentive indexes and object files) were proposed in order to explain
the mechanisms of MOT in humans. Cavanagh & Alvarez (2005) as well as Oksama & Hyönä (2004)
described these models in detail: The grouping and switching approaches only require a single focus
of attention. The moving objects are grouped into a higher order object and the participant can then
track the changing shape and handle the task with only one attentional channel. Additionally, when
targets share common motion (e.g. move in the same direction), they group more strongly and tracking
becomes easier. Switching required the participants to cycle through the targets and keeping track of
all positions and anticipated locations. The multifocal attentional approach assumes that each target
requires an independent focus of attention and this focus needs to be held until the movement of
objects stops. The preattentive indexes model is somewhat similar to the multifocal model, it differs
in the view that there is no explicit attentional focus needed to follow an object. The object files
model is not an alternative model to e.g. multifocal attention, instead it describes in more detail which
constituent processes are required to accumulate information about each moving object.
Summing up, MOT addresses the question, how well participants can perform in visuo-spatial,
visual memory, multifocal and divided attentional tasks. Those tasks are all crucial for esport- as
well as traditional sport performance.

**BACKGROUND**

As mentioned, there is a clear link between MOT and esport performance. For example, the
differentiation of performance has been subject of esport science, as regular gamers outperformed
novices in different attentional tasks (Hubert-Wallander et al., 2011) and gaming experts could
track objects at greater speed compared to non-gamers (Boot et al., 2008). There are two feasible
explanations for these differences in performance. One is given by multiple studies which have shown
that playing video games can have positive effects on attentional and visuo-spatial cognition such
as MOT (Bejianki et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2018; Trisolini et al., 2018). These findings indicate that
playing video games regularly improves those aspects of cognition and therefore the ability of MOT.
Another possible explanation for the differences between gaming experts and novices is, that people
with a better initial ability of MOT might be more successful in esport competitions and therefore
engage more regularly and tend to be more successful.
MOT ability is also relevant in traditional team ball sports which constantly challenge players
with complex and dynamic motions (Cavanagh et al., 2014; Memmert, 2009; Qiu et al., 2018; Scholl,
2009; Williams et al., 2006). The ability plays an important role in individual sports such as karate
or fencing, where athletes need to distinguish and simultaneously process the cues of the opposing
body during a sequence of attacks or counterattacks (Mouton & Oberle, 2007). The assessment of
MOT helped to differentiate elite athletes from novice and non-athlete populations (Alves et al., 2013;
Faubert, 2013; Faubert & Sidebottom 2012; Qiu et al., 2018). Voss et al. (2009) also found in their
review that expert athletes performed better in tasks that required processing speed and visual attention
compared to amateurs. MOT paradigms have not only been used for performance assessment, but
also to successfully train soccer players’ decision making (Romeas et al., 2016) and other sporting
related abilities (Junye et al., 2015). Fleddermann et al. (2019) also found better training effects of a
MOT training on perceptual-cognitive tasks in comparison to traditional training. Moreover, MOT
correlated to the performance of players in the National Basketball Association of the United States
of America (Mangine et al., 2014). Summing up, MOT is seen to be relevant in both esport and
traditional sport. It has, among other goals, been used to differentiate performance in both fields.
Up to now, studies have compared either experts and novices in one of the two fields or, in the case
of esport, collated gamers to a non-gamer population. No comparison between differently skilled
advanced esport players and sportsmen previously has been made (García-Lanzo et al., 2018) and
studies that involve esport players from the highest level are lacking, possibly because of the low
accessibility of professional players.


**AIM OF THE STUDY AND HYPOTHESES**

The current study is an experimental and practically oriented approach to address this gap by
comparing the MOT ability of three relevant groups of participants: professional and amateur esport
players, as well as traditional sportsmen. The traditional sportsmen implemented in this study might
also function as a control group for the other two, because they did not play esport games regularly.
The following three hypotheses are formulated:


- Professional esport players have superior attentional and visuo-spatial cognition compared to
novice esport players, possibly as a result of their greater practice time in esport games.

- Professional esport players and traditional sportsmen show comparable attentional and visuospatial cognition, possibly as a result of their practice times in either traditional sport or esport

- Traditional sportsmen have superior attentional and visuo-spatial cognition compared to novice
esport players, possibly as a result of their practice time in traditional sport

**METHODS**

**Study Design and Participants**

The current cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2018 and April 2019. Young adults
were recruited via notices in public places or via the websites of the German Sport University Cologne
and the research project. Respondents were accepted for the study if they met the following inclusion
criteria, as assessed by self-report: (1) they were physically and mentally healthy, including normal
or corrected to normal vision and with no color blindness, and (2) they did not suffer from blind
spots in their view. Furthermore, three definitions were used to classify the participants: Professional
players earned money as a main income by playing competitively in tournaments. Amateur players
were playing competitively in tournaments but did not earn money as a main income by doing so.
Traditional sportsmen did not play video games more than five times a month and performed their main
sport at least twice a week. None of them earned money as a main income by performing their sport.
All self-reports were done via self-designed questionnaires, in accordance with a physician. In
addition to the self-report, blind spot diagnosis was carried out with the “multifixation campimeter
(basic)” software (St Paul’s Eye Unit; Royal Liverpool University Hospital) and the “EyesCream
II” software (MGM). Both software packages are publicly available and were calibrated and used
according to the developers’ specifications.
Table 1 represents the descriptive data for the professional and amateur esports players. The data
for game time per week refer to the last six weeks. The games played by professional players were
_FIFA_ 20 (n=13), _League of Legends_ (n=4), _PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds_ (PUBG Corporation,
2017, n=1) and. _Trackmania 2: Stadium_ (Nadeo,2013, n=1). Amateur player’s main games were
_League of Legends_ (n=10), _FIFA_ (n=5), _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_ (n=3), _PlayerUnknown’s_
_Battlegrounds_ (n=2), _Clash Royale_ (Supercell, 2016. n=1) and _Madden NFL 2019_ = National Football
League (EA Tiburon, 2019, n=1). Amateur players often played more than one game.
Table 2 represents the descriptive data for the traditional sportsmen. The data for game time
and traditional sports per week refer to the last six weeks. Main sports performed were team sports
(9; e.g., basketball, volleyball, soccer, handball), track and field (5) and fitness (4) among others and
in combination.
The overall sample size of our study was 59 (19 professional players, 22 amateur players and
18 traditional sportsmen/control group) and is therefore higher than the larger sample sizes in the
literature. For example:


- Bejianki et al. (2014) compared 10 to 11 participants in training a study

|Col1|Age (years)|Sports experience (years)|Sports time (h) / Week|
|---|---|---|---|
|Traditional sportsmen (n =<br>18, 11 females)|23.72 ± 3.41|12.22 ± 4.60|8.40 ± 4.60|

Table 3 shows the number of groups and overall sample size of comparable studies.
The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of the German Sport University Cologne
(reference: 053/2018), and all participants signed an informed consent statement in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. One participant was underage (17 years old) and presented a legal
guardian’s consent to be able to participate.

**Multiple Object Tracking Testing**

Testing software was developed by Faubert and Sidebottom (2012) and is commercially available
(Neurotracker©, CogniSens Athletic, Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada). All Participants completed
three sessions, each consisting of 20 trials. The software functioned as follows: In each trial, a
transparent cube with a green cross in the centre was presented. Inside the cube, eight identical yellow
balls were randomly distributed. Four of the balls were highlighted for two seconds. After returning
to original colour, the balls moved individually throughout the entire cube for eight seconds. The
movements were affected by collisions with the walls of the cube or other balls. At the end of the
eight-second period, all balls stopped and the camera moved very slowly around the cube to avoid
possible occlusion of subjacent balls. Each ball was assigned a number from 1 to 8 by the software
and participants were instructed to identify the four balls originally highlighted at the beginning of
the trial (for whole sequence see Figures 1, 2 and 3).
The speed of the starting trial of each session was identical for every participant, but it was
different in session one compared to session two and three. Session one started at speed 0.3, whereas
session two and three started at the speed of 0.7. The speed at which the balls moved in every
following trial was dependent on the correct identification of the highlighted balls and was adjusted
immediately. Speed adaptation followed a one up one down staircase fashion (Levitt, 1971) in which
multiple correct trials in succession lead to a heightened increase for the third and the subsequent
correct trials. All these specifications are used as standard configuration by the software and are
recommended by the developers.
In the first session, participants worked on the 2D version of the task; for sessions two and three,
the 3D version was used. The balls were then displayed as two overlapping 2D images with slightly
different perspectives, as can be seen in Figure 4.

**Figure 1. Highlighting of the relevant balls**


When perceived with stereoscopic glasses, these two images converted into a 3D image. This
is again based on developer’s recommendations. None of the participants reported problems with
either of the two versions.

**General Procedures**

Testing was conducted by experienced instructors that were specially trained in explaining, executing
and monitoring the tests. Training of instructors was conducted in consultation with the developers
of the software and took place in the laboratory where later testing was executed. It included details
about the setup of the testing computer as well as all details described in the previous section. The
testing procedure itself was part of an extensive test battery that was carried out within the same
day, which is why only a limited time slot could be granted for the MOT test covered in this study.

**Figure 4. Display of the two 2D images with slightly different perspectives used for the 3D trials**


The feasible three sessions of MOT testing took 20 to 25 minutes, dependent on voluntary and freely
selectable breaks in between sessions.
Participants were tested separately in the laboratory and were sitting in front of a PC in an
otherwise darkened room and used either the mouse or keypad to identify the highlighted balls
after a trial. Participants could freely choose their individual optimal distance from the screen and
adjust keypad and mouse placement or mouse speed or if needed. No calibration of the software or
hardware was necessary. First, the examiner read aloud the instructions and explained the task, which
included a practice trial that could be repeated if necessary. Instructions included the procedure of
the overall upcoming testing, the possibility to take a break in between sessions, the procedure of a
single trial as well as the speed adaptation as a consequence of correct or false identification of the
moving objects (see previous section).
He then withdrew from participants’ view and supervised the procedure without disturbing or
interacting with the participant. No retesting of any participant was necessary. Retesting should also
be considered with caution, because possible training effects could influence the results.

**Data Analysis**

The score value of each session was used as the dependent variable for the study. The score was
determined to be the fastest speed at which participants could correctly identify all four highlighted
balls 50% of the time. The score was automatically calculated by the testing software.
Means of session one, two and three were separately calculated for each participant. Afterwards,
means of session one, two and three were calculated for the three groups (professional players, all
amateur players and all traditional sportsmen) separately. Because of software recording issues, a
total of three sessions from three different participants were not recorded. Because of this missing
data, 1.70% of those means could not be calculated and were instead imputed from other participants’
means. No outliers were excluded from statistical analyses because all means were within the range
M ± 3.29 SD, a criterion adopted from Tabachnick and Fidell (2001), with M and SD representing
the mean and standard deviation across trials and participants.
Because of the different starting values for the scores and 2D (session one) vs 3D versions of the
task, session one had to be analysed separately from sessions two and three. A one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with the mean score of session one as dependent variable and the independent
variable “group” (professional and amateur esport players as well as traditional sportsmen) was
conducted. Additionally, a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors session (two and three) and
the between-subject factor group was conducted. The degrees of freedom were not adjusted since
the assumption of sphericity was not violated in any ANOVA.
Two-sample t-tests were used to compare esport playtime of professional players and amateur
players in hours per week and overall (years).
To examine possible associations between MOT score values and esport playtime (hours
per week), overall esport participation (years), sport activity (hours per week) and overall sport
participation (years), partial Pearson correlations were calculated for both esport player groups
combined and the separate group of sportsmen.

**Figure 5. Esport playtime of professionals and amateurs**


All calculations were controlled for age and gender, to prevent an influence of these factors, since
there is an inevitable gender distribution in esport player groups. Because there were more female
participants in the sportsmen group, all analysis were conducted including and excluding female
participants, in case there were differences related to the gender. Results were tested for significant
differences between male and female participants within the three groups, as well as for differences
between the three groups including and excluding female participants. None of the analysis indicated
that male and female participants differed in any outcome. Therefore, female participants were
not excluded in statistical analysis to strengthen the power of the data through a larger number of
participants. Additionally, we controlled all ANOVAS by using age and again gender as covariates
and again found no significant differences. Correlation analysis were controlled by using partial
Pearson correlations with control variables age and gender.


**RESULTS**

Experience and playtime data are presented in Table 1 and 2 in the _study design and participant_
section. T-test showed that professional players played significantly more esport / week ( _t_ (39) = 3.342, _p_ < 0.05), as displayed in Figure 5. T-test did not show any difference in overall esport playtime
(years). Figure 5 shows mean esport playtime + standard deviation overall (years) and over the last
six months (weekly hours) of professional and amateur esport players.
As can be seen in Table 4, the one-way ANOVA revealed, that scores differed between groups in
session one ( _F_ (2,56) = 3.380; _p_ < 0.05, ηp [2] = 0.108) Bonferroni post-hoc tests further differentiated
that professional players had significantly ( _p_ < 0.05) higher scores compared to amateur players in
session one (0.300, 95%- CI [0.01, 0.58]). Figure 6 accordingly shows mean score values + standard
deviations of the three sessions across individuals in all three groups. Dotted horizontal lines indicate
starting speed of sessions. The pervaded vertical line separates session one (2D) and session two/
three (3D).
The repeated-measures ANOVA for session two and three yielded a significant effect of _session_
(F (2,56) = 4.427; p < 0.05, ηp [2] = 0.073. Scores were significantly higher in session three compared
to session two (post hoc: p < 0.05; 0.088, 95% CI [0.04, 0.172]), but the interaction _session*group_
was not significant, which means that no group differences were found between the two sessions.
Pearson correlations revealed positive associations between _hours of esport / week_ over the last
six months and the score values of session one ( _r_ = 0.421; _p_ < 0.05), as plotted in Figure 7.

**DISCUSSION**

The present study evaluated and compared the essential ability of MOT in three groups: professional
esport players, amateur esport players and traditional sportsmen. Only tendentious results could
be obtained in this comparison. Professional players outperformed amateur players in the first of

three sessions. Related to this finding, correlation analysis revealed a positive association between
weekly esport playtime and score values in session one. No further significant group differences or
associations were found.
The first hypothesis can be partly supported, professional players did outperform amateur players,
but only in the first session. Professional players might adapt more quickly to the MOT paradigm
and therefore initially perform better.
There was support for the second hypothesis, no significant difference between professional
players and traditional sportsmen was observed in any of the three sessions. Improvements in attentional
and visuo-spatial cognition of professional esport players might be comparable in magnitude to those
gained by traditional sportsmen.
There was no support found for the third hypothesis, MOT performance of traditional sportsmen
and amateur players did not differ statistically. Playing esport titles on a lower competitive (amateur)
level possibly still induces some improvements of MOT performance.

**Differences Between Esport Professionals and Amateurs**

In the first session, professional players showed better MOT performance than amateur players. This
is somewhat in line with multiple studies that showed how expert video gamers were able to track
objects at greater speeds compared to non-experts (Boot et al., 2008; Green & Bavelier, 2003; Trick
et al., 2005). It is important to note that, in those studies, expert video gamers were categorized by
the amount of time they played video games (e.g., for multiple years, several times a week for at
least one hour), but not by their level of competition, which has also been criticized in the literature
(Dale et al., 2020). They might have been experts by former definitions, even if they did not compete
in tournaments at all. To our knowledge, the present study is one of the first to compare actual
professional players with amateur players. All esport players in the present study would have been
classified as experts by the definition in former studies (Boot et al., 2008; Green & Bavelier, 2003;
Trick et al., 2005), that was based solely on playtime. It is conceivable that the entirety of esport
players in the present study (professional players and amateur players) would have also outperformed
the non-experts of the mentioned earlier studies.
It is already known that general playing of (action-) video games can have a positive effect on
tasks like object tracking, that involve attention and visuo-spatial cognition (Hubert-Wallander et
al., 2011; Milani et al., 2019; Spence & Feng, 2010; Trisolini et al., 2018). This finding might be
further differentiated by the present study because of the positive correlation between weekly esport
play time and first session MOT performance found in the esport cohort. Professional players played
more hours per week and outperformed amateur players in session one, but not session two and three.
One possible explanation is a higher entry performance or quicker familiarization with the tracking
task of players with a very high esport playtime. This effect possibly leveled off during sessions two
and three. Additionally, sessions two and three were performed in the 3D version, which might be
unfamiliar to all three groups because esport titles usually played by participants are not played in 3D
with stereoscopic glasses. This might limit the benefits granted by high esport playtime and negate
group differences from session one in later sessions.

**No Differences Between Sportsmen and Esport Players**

MOT performance differences between the esport player groups and traditional sportsmen were
not statistically significant. The mean score value of the traditional sportsmen group was between
professional players and amateur players. Traditional sportsmen in the present study practised their
respective sport much shorter than esport players played video games (about three times less often than
amateur players and about four and a half times less often than professional players). This might be
another indication that both esport as well as traditional sport influence the basic ability of MOT (or
underlying skills) and that sportsmen acquire a comparable level by far less time-consuming practice.
Unfortunately, our data do not tell which kind of traditional sport impacts MOT performance to a


**26**


**International Journal of eSports Research**

greater extent. This is because participants were recruited independently from their sporting focus
and we found no associations between specific sporting activities and MOT performance, due to the
limited number of participants in each activity. The data also does not reveal an association between
traditional sports activity time and MOT performance.

**Differences Between Study Participants and General Population**

Scores of the samples are higher than the scores of the normal population without esport or traditional
sport context that are documented in the literature (Faubert, 2013; Qiu et al., 2018). This could be
due to either:


- Both traditional sport and esport activity and expertise positively influencing MOT performance,
which is in line with the literature (Alves et al., 2013; Bejianki et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2018;
Fleddermann et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2018; Trick et al., 2005; Voss et al., 2009), or

- The participants in this study inherently had higher levels of MOT ability than does the general
population. These higher MOT ability levels perhaps led these individuals to participate in
either esports or traditional sports, due to psychological gratification from inherently superior
performance.


The second assumption is fundamentally oriented and difficult to prove directly. It is possible
that certain individuals have developed better cognitive abilities for a variety of reasons. Genetical
disposition, cognitive training in other fields such as music or fine motor tasks could all lead to MOT
abilities above average. This over average abilities could lead to early success in the field of esport or
traditional sport, which is known to be a factor for continuous participation (Hollings et al., 2014).
The first assumption on the other hand is broadly described in the literature. Voss et al. (2009)
found in their review that expert athletes performed better in tasks that required processing speed and
visual attention. This is confirmed by Alves et al. (2013) that found marginally higher performance in
comparable measures for elite volleyball players than in amateurs. Qiu et al. (2018) acquired similar
results. They analyzed the MOT performance of elite, mediocre and non-athletes in traditional sports
and found comparable results to the present study. Elite athletes even outperformed both other groups,
whereas in our study professional esport players only slightly outperformed amateurs. Fleddermann
et al. (2019) could moreover show a better training effect on cognitive processes of a MOT-task
compared to regular ball training. The higher performance level in perceptual-cognitive tasks of experts
compared to amateurs was also confirmed for esport. Bejianki et al. (2014) found better perceptional
abilities in videogame players compared to a control group and Ding et al. (2018) even more precisely
reported higher MOT performance of expert players compared to controls. This is again in line with
the assumption of the bullet point. Furthermore, the literature also reflects that MOT can be used to
differentiate elite traditional sportsmen from amateur and non-sportive populations (Faubert, 2013;
Faubert & Sidebottom 2012; Qiu et al., 2018), and indicates a positive association to NBA players’
performance (Mangine et al., 2014).

**MOT as a Possible Chance for Diversified Training**

From the players’ and sportsmen’s point of view, it is interesting to speculate about realizable benefits
of different training methods. It seems as if both esport and sport activity positively influences MOT
performance and that a better MOT ability is associated with the professionalism of esport play.
Therefore, the adaptation of existing training habits to improve individual’s performance provides a
promising opportunity. Existing studies show that MOT training improves underlying perceptional
abilities and, as a consequence, sports performance (Junye et al., 2015). One study (Romeas et al.,
2016) for example found improvement in in-game parameters and therefore proved a transfer effect,
in this case, for decision-making and passing accuracy in basketball. Other findings show an increase
in MOT ability, but found no transferable effects (Moen et al., 2018) or documented improved basic

Volume 1 • Issue 1 • January-June 2021


mental skills such as sustained attention or processing speed, but also found no transfer to specific sport
related parameters such as jumping performance (Fleddermann et al., 2019). Despite the ambiguous
results, it might in summary be of great benefit for both esport players and traditional sportsmen
to improve their MOT ability with varying training methods and profit from possible basic ability
improvements and transfer effects.


**LIMITATIONS**

There are several factors that limit the findings of the study including the sample size, the diverse
esport titles played by participants and the diverse fields of sports the sportsmen were recruited from.
Also, study design aspects such as daytime of testing, the original purpose of the testing software and
the low number of sessions performed must be respected when interpreting the results.
The study compared 19 professional esport players, 22 amateur esport players and 18 traditional
sportsmen, which is the lower limit to perform reliable analysis between three groups. The sample
size however is bigger than in most comparable studies (Bejianki et al., 2014; Boot et al., 2008;
Ding et al., 2018; Hubert-Wallander et al., 2011) as stated in the study design section. The fact that
our outcomes are not clearer seems to be due to the actually non-existent or very small differences
between the participant groups.
Additionally, the groups of esport-players were not recruited solely from one main played title and
the sportsmen were not recruited with the focus on specific fields of sport. This limits the significance
of correlation calculations, but can be attributed to practical reasons. It is difficult to attain professional
players in general and we decided to open up the field of played titles in order to achieve at least an
acceptable overall sample size. As a consequence of the professional players playing several different
esport-titles, we also opened up the criteria for amateur players and traditional sportsmen.
As in most studies, participants could freely choose the daytime to participate in the experiment,
which leads to possible differences in performance based on personal peaks or lows. This is hardly
controllable but is a problem of nearly every comparable study. Also, the freely chooseable breaks
in between sessions might influence participants performance. Not granting breaks on the other
hand would influence the results even more, because we could not guarantee that participants are as
recovered as possible at the beginning of each session.
Another limitation concerns the use of the testing software to compare initial performance.
The software is mainly designed as a training tool. It is also used for diagnosis, but on a much rarer
basis. The low number of sessions (3) and the different graphical presentation (2D and 3D) make it
additionally hard to compare broad data. Maybe the results would become clearer when executing a
much higher number of sessions and concentrating on only one graphical presentation. This again is
limited by participants availability, especially when testing professional players.
To minimize further impacts on the results, all outcomes were controlled for age and gender
which did not result in any change.


**CONCLUSION**

The present study is new in that it is the first to compare the MOT performance of three relevant groups:
professional esport players, amateur esport players and traditional sportsmen. To our knowledge, no
studies that assess the performance of professional players and compare it to other player groups have
been published yet. Professional players outperformed amateur players in the first session, which
was the only group difference found. Positive association of esport playtime and MOT performance
as well as elevated MOT-scores of the entire study cohort compared to normal population indicate a
connection of esport and sport activity and tracking performance. As stated in the discussion, other
research has collected evidence that advanced esport players as well as expert traditional athletes show
higher performance levels in MOT paradigms. This is possibly because of well-trained underlying


**28**

cognitive processes that result in better results for visuo-spatial, visual memory, multifocal and
divided attentional tasks. Our results point in the same direction, because a high engagement time in
esports seems to correlate with better MOT performance. Additionally, general engagement in either
esport or traditional sport seemed to elevate the ability of MOT in the study cohort above the normal
population. This connection might be also used to positively influence training habits of both esport
players and sportsmen. The findings that a general engagement in esport and traditional sport seems
to elevate MOT performance and that both sports training and cognitive training can improve MOT
performance offer new training possibilities. Traditional sportsmen could integrate cognitive MOT
training at a computer, esport players could engage in traditional sport activities that foster the MOT
ability and people that did not engage in either activity might benefit largely from both possibilities.
Future research should focus on eradicating the present limitations such as sample size and
diversity of genres the players and sportsmen were recruited from. Larger groups of professional
players, amateur players and traditional sportsmen only from one field of esport or sport should be
compared in more sessions of MOT, possibly over a larger time interval. This would also give more
insight into the learning curves of individuals. It would also be of use to include non-athlete-nonesport participants to examine and emphasize possible benefits of both esport and sport on MOT
performance.
