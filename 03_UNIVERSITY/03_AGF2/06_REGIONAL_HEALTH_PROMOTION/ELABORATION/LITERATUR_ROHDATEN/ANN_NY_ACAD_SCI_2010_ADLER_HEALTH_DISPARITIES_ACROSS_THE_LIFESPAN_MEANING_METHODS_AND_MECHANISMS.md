Health disparities have become of central concern in
the United States and globally. Populations within
the United States experience marked differences in
health and longevity. Differences among racial and
ethnic groups are pronounced; for example, about
twice as many Blacks and Hispanics report being
in fair or poor health than do Whites. Differences
are even greater by SES; almost five times as many
adults in poverty report fair or poor health compared to those with the highest income. [1] Income
inequality has increased in the United States over
the past 30 years due to differential change in real
family income. In 1979, the top 5% of families had
average incomes that were 11.4 times larger than
that of the bottom 20%; however, by 2005, the ratio
had risen to 20.9 times greater. [2] During this period,
real income fell slightly for those at the bottom while
skyrocketing for those at the top. From the lowest to
the highest income quintiles, the changes in income
were −1%, 9%, 15%, 25%, and 53%, respectively. [3]

These trends have raised alarm about the impact
of a skewed distribution of societal resources on so

cial and physical well-being. Public health officials
have called attention to this problem and pledged
to reduce it. Healthy People 2010 that was released
in January, 2000 and set goals for the health of the
United States in the first decade of the 21st century, had two overarching goals: (l) to increase the
quality and years of healthy life; and (2) to eliminate
health disparities which were defined as “differences
that occur by gender, race or ethnicity, education or
income, disability, geographic location, or sexual
orientation” (p. 11). [4]

A midcourse review of progress toward achievement of Healthy People 2010 goals is sobering.
Despite an explosion of research, and increasing
life expectancy, significant differences remain along
racial and ethnic, and socioeconomic (SES) lines. [5]

Progress was measured in 28 focus areas with 467
specific objectives (e.g., increase the proportion of
adolescents who participate in daily school physical education, decrease the proportion consuming
more than 10% of calories from saturated fat). Disparities in health between racial and ethnic groups

have lessened for some objectives, but these gains
have been partially offset by increases in disparities on other objectives. For 195 objectives and
sub-objectives with trend data for racial and ethnic groups, 14 showed increases in disparities and
24 showed decreases. Data on changes in disparities due to education or income are lacking for
many Healthy People 2010 objectives but the few
available indicators show even more discouraging
trends; disparities among educational groups decreased for three objectives or sub-objectives but
increased for 14, and there were few changes in disparities for income groups. We are clearly not going
to eliminate health disparities by 2010, and there is
some question whether we will have reduced them
in any meaningful way or if some will actually have
increased. This adds urgency to the need to understand how disparities emerge and how they can be
eliminated.


Defining health disparities
Although eliminating health disparities is a frequently voiced aspiration, there is little consensus
on its definition. [6] Health disparities frequently refer to disparities in health care, including differential access to screening and/or treatment options,
or unequal availability of culturally or linguistically
knowledgeable and sensitive health personnel. It is
also used in the United States to refer to differences
in health care or health status among different racial
and ethnic groups, whereas in the United Kingdom
and European nations it more frequently refers to
differences associated with social class and socioeconomic status (SES). Despite their differences, most
definitions share a common element of identifying a
disparity as a difference in health status between social groups (e.g., socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, gender) that is not only unnecessary and avoidable, but
in addition, is considered unfair and unjust. [7] In recent years, the term “health inequities” has been
used more frequently, emphasizing the injustice of
the difference in health status. Because the definition of health disparities includes the characteristic
of injustice, we use the terms “health disparities”
and“healthinequalities”interchangeablyinthisvolume. In addition, to maintain continuity with our
previous work, the former term is primarily used.
Inthefollowingpapers,weexaminedifferencesin
health status associated with SES and associated disadvantage, and the biological processes responsible



for these outcomes. Socioeconomic deprivation is a
key mechanism through which other bases of social
disadvantage, particularly those linked to race and
ethnicity, result in poorer health status. [8] Health disparities associated with race and ethnicity receive
more attention in the United States for a number
of reasons, including greater availability of data on
racial and ethnic differences in health and receipt of
health care services than on social class differences.
The United States is unlike most other countries in
its failure to collect health statistics regarding social class. [8] As a result, as Isaacs and Schroeder [9] have
observed, class is an “ignored determinant” of the
nation’s health.


Evolution of health disparities research
in the United States
Interest in health disparities has grown geometrically over the past 20 years. A primary contributor to this surge is the persistence of health disparities despite improvements in medical care and
public health prevention initiatives. The number of
studies on disparities associated with SES as well
as by race/ethnicity has increased dramatically. Researchers are asking more complex questions, and
using more sophisticated approaches and methods.
Within the last 20 years, one can identify several
distinct eras of work on health disparities associated
with SES. New questions addressed in later eras of
researchdidnotreplacetheneedforfurtherworkon
questions posed in prior eras, but often added new
complexity and depth to the questions and/or the
methods for answering them. The first era used a
threshold framework; poverty was conceptualized
as a categorical determinant of health. The second era added greater nuance in examining graded
associations between health status and socioeconomic resources resulting from higher education,
income, and occupational status across the entire
SES hierarchy, and began to consider how socioeconomic position intersected with social disadvantage associated with gender and with race/ethnicity.
The third era began to identify mechanisms linking
SES and health, attempting to discover the intermediate processes accounting for the graded relationship observed in the studies of the second era.
The fourth era added the complexity of multilevel
effects, such as the independent contribution of
neighborhood characteristics above and beyond those of individuals’ own socioeconomic

characteristics. And an emerging fifth era is looking at interactions among such factors, not simply
their main effects. Such work is looking, for example, at how the impact of individual SES is modified
by neighborhood environments.


**First era: poverty as threshold**


The first era of research occurred before there was
an explicit discussion of “health disparities.” The
strongrelationshipbetweenSESandhealthhasbeen
observed for centuries and in many countries. [10–12]

Earlier observations, conceptual frameworks, and
methods of analysis foreshadow the evolution of
work on health disparities that has occurred during
the last 20 years in the United States, as well as the
continuing debate over what lens to use to view the
problem.
The importance of socioeconomic conditions for
health was explicitly studied in the 19th century.
William Farr worked for over 40 years to document the socioeconomic differences in disease in
England. [13] In the mid-1800s, Rudolf Virchow [14]

identified poverty and unemployment, lack of education, and political disenfranchisement as essential sources of disease. At the end of the century,
Durkheim [15] discussed differences in suicide rates
as a social rather than individual phenomenon.
Friedrich Engels [16] saw poverty and unemployment
as fostering ill-health, and placed primary responsibility on the “upstream” force of the political economy of Victorian England. This thread has been
carried forward by current day scholars including
Doyal, [17] Link & Phelan, [18] Navarro, [19] Townsend, [20]

Tesh, [21] and Kreiger, [22] who argue for examination of
the societal processes that create the socioeconomic
conditions that result in health disparities.
Twentieth century theory and research provided
a foundation for studies on the cascade of factors
resulting from socioeconomic position and their
impact on health. The bio-psycho-social model formulated by George Engels [23] hypothesized that a variety of pathogens, including psychosocial factors
suchasstressorsandlifestyles,combinetofosterdisease. This conceptualization provided a framework
for multilevel analysis and research on processes
suchascumulativeriskandallostaticload(seeEvans
and Kim and McEwen and Gianaros, in this volume). Medical sociologist Aaron Antonovsky [24] _[,]_ [25]

added another dimension through his exploration



of factors that help people to cope successfully with
the unavoidable stressors in life. This work developed the concept of “salutogenesis” and emphasized the importance of a “sense of coherence”—
comprehending, managing, and seeing meaning.
While Antonovsky’s work was based on individual functioning, it also provided an intellectual precursor to research on the health-promoting (or, in
Antonovsky’s words, “salutogenic”) aspects of social
environments that can mediate or buffer effects of
low SES (see Matthews, Gallo, and Taylor, in this
volume). At the social level this extends to concepts
of social capital and neighborhood cohesion (see
Diez Roux and Mair, in this volume).
In the second half of the 20th century, empirical
work done by Kitagawa & Hauser [26] examined associations of mortality with both income and education in a nationally representative sample of the U.S.
population. This work signaled increased quantitative interest in the relationship between social factors and health. Kitagawa and Hauser found monotonic inverse relationships of income and education
with mortality which were independent of one another, and found that the association was stronger
for adults age 25–64 than for those over age 65. The
Black Report in England [27] documented increasing
disparities in mortality by social class despite the
establishment of the National Health Service. This
unexpected finding was attributed to growing inequality in England over the period examined and
the impact of material hardship among the disadvantaged.
With the notable exception of Kitagawa and
Hauser, the vast majority of research before the mid1980s on socioeconomic contributors to health in
the United States did not examine income as a continuum but focused on poverty. [28] The most common study design involved a comparison of health
status or mortality for individuals whose individual
or household income fell below the federal poverty
line compared with those who were above this line.
The underlying assumption was that a meaningful
threshold was crossed when a person moved out
of poverty and that differences in morbidity and
mortality were due to material deprivation. In this
model,increasingincomebelowthepovertylineimpacts health up to the point where income becomes
sufficient to move the individual or family out of
poverty, at which point further increases in income
have little or no effect on health. The socioeconomic

variables of education or occupational status were
not as often studied in this era and this work was
not explicitly conceptualized or framed in terms of
disparities.
There was also substantial research on racial differences in health in this era. Most of the research
documented differences between blacks and whites.
There was little examination, however, of the relationship of race and SES or appreciation of the
fact that racial prejudice and discriminatory policies relegated a higher proportion of blacks to lower
rungs of the SES ladder. Subsequent studies have
shown that socioeconomic disadvantage accounts
for some, but not all, of the racial differences in
health [8] _[,]_ [29] _[,]_ [30] (see Williams et al., in this volume).
In this earlier era, although most studies made either SES or race/ethnicity the primary focus, with
only passing attention to adequate measurement
and tracking of the other. There was also relatively
little research on the health status of other racial and
ethnic groups.
Convincing data on the link between poverty and
higher mortality fueled interest in the impact of financial resources on health. The few studies that
looked above the poverty line found that the influenceofsocioeconomicpositiononhealthcontinued
to operate. These findings suggested that it might
not only be extreme material privations associated
with poverty that had health effects but other factors
associated with SES. These observations did not cohere into a concerted research focus however until
late in the century.


**Second era: gradients**


In response to the empirical work linking SES to
health a second era of work arose during the mid1980s. Although we term this a second era, it is
actually the beginning of work undertaken with an
explicit framing of “health disparities.” The Whitehall studies of civil servants galvanized interest in
the power of socioeconomic forces and ushered in
this new era. [31–33] The powerful unexpected finding
from the first Whitehall Study was that there was a
monotonic relationship of occupational grade and
health at all levels of the occupational hierarchy. Not
only did those at the bottom of the occupational
grades have worse health and higher mortality than
thoseabovethem,but,inaddition,improvementsin
health and longevity were observed at each succes


sive step up the occupational grades, all the way up
to the highest level. These findings were particularly
notable since they occurred within a population in
which all participants were employed and living well
above the poverty line. It challenged the assumption
of a threshold of income above which increasing resources would not benefit health. The results also
challenged the view that social class differences in
health resulted solely from material privation, and
initiated a debate which became more vocal in the
third era
AsecondaspectoftheWhitehallstudyalsohelped
galvanize interest in health disparities. The glaring
problemoflackofuniversalhealthcareintheUnited
Stateshasbeenafocusofintenseconcernanddebate
for some time. The dominance of this issue suggests
an implicit assumption that universal coverage will
solve the problem of disparities. Although the Black
Report [27] had shown this not to be the case in England, results from the Whitehall studies reinforced
those findings. The fact that substantial differences
in morbidity and mortality were found across the
SES hierarchy despite the availability of health care
for all the Whitehall participants, ruled out differential health care as a major factor in determining
disparities in mortality.
The powerful findings from the Whitehall studies spurred investigators to see if a similar gradient
would be found in the United States. This was challenging to do using existing data sets because most
did not have data that were sufficiently detailed to
evaluate gradients. As noted earlier, most studies
coded people only in terms of whether they were
above or below the poverty line. Despite this, a number of papers reported gradients in disease prevalence and mortality rates. [34–36] In addition, Pappas
_et al._ [37] demonstrated that the gap in mortality between richer and poorer individuals and between
those with more or less education, had increased
between l960, when Kitagawa and Hauser did their
analysis, and l986. The findings echo the focus in the
first era on the importance of poverty, as the steepest drop in mortality occurs as income increases
at the very bottom of the income distribution (see
Fig. 1). At the same time, mortality continues to drop as income increases even well into
higher levels [38] (see Dow and Rehkopf, in this
volume).
The studies described earlier demonstrated the
SES-health gradient in adults. During this era,

studies also revealed that gradients emerge early
in life. The lower the SES of a child’s parents, the
more likely the child is to experience a number of
health problems, including injury, asthma, ear disease, limiting chronic conditions, and physical inactivity [39] (see Cohen _et al_ ., in this volume.) The
accumulation of social disadvantage is linked to
poorer health among children [40] _[,]_ [41] (see Evans and
Kim, in this volume). Among children in the 1994
and 1995 National Health Interview Survey Disability Supplement, for example, greater accumulation of family indicators of low SES were associated
with greater odds that children would not be in
very good or excellent health, would have a chronic
condition, or would have an activity limitation.
Controlling for health insurance did not affect the
findings. [42]

Although evidence about gradients among both
children and adults emerged primarily in this second era, work continues to establish the strength
and shape of the gradient at different ages. The periodoflifeinwhichhealthdisparitiesarethegreatest
is middle adulthood (age 40–65); disparities at this
life stage may reflect the cumulative effects of differential exposures associated with socioeconomic
disadvantage over the prior lifecourse. Disparities
narrow after age 65, although the reasons for this
have not been established. Safety nets, including Social Security and Medicare, which become active at



this age, may account for some degree of narrowing.
Alternately, differential selection of those who have
survived to age 65 in populations that have experienced more or less adverse conditions over their
lifetime may also contribute to the narrower gap. Althoughdiminished,thegradientdoesnotdisappear,
however, and has been found in older populations.
For example, Minkler _et al._ [43] found a social-class
gradient in functional limitations for both men and
women between the ages of 55 and 84 (but not beyond), which was present even at the upper rungs
of the socioeconomic ladder.
Questions remain about the steepness of the gradient within childhood and adolescence. There is
a clear gradient between SES and early fetal and
neonatal loss. [44] However, once infants survive this
period, socioeconomic differences in health are
much smaller. While some report that differences
become negligible as children enter adolescence, [45]

there are conflicting findings. For example, Case
_et al._ [46] found an increasingly steep gradient between
family income and health as children get older. One
reason for conflicting findings may be the use of differenthealthindicators.Thestrengthandpatterning
of the gradient differs depending on the outcome
being examined. For some health problems, there
is an increasingly steep gradient over childhood
and adolescence (the cumulative model as reported
by Case _et al._ ), [46] for other health outcomes, the

gradient decreases (the convergence model, as reported by West). [45] Sample composition and variable calculations can also result in conflicting findings [47] _[,]_ [48] (seeCohen _etal._,inthisvolumeforafurther
discussion of associated conceptual models).
Research establishing the gradient relationship
between SES and health is primarily cross-sectional,
and the causal direction cannot be firmly established. Most researchers interpret the association
in terms of SES determining health status. However, some researchers have shown that health status
also affects SES. Among adults age 50 and older in
the Health and Retirement Study, Smith [49] showed
that individuals who experienced episodes of poorer
health had subsequent drops in income resulting
from health care costs and/or reduced involvement
in work or early retirement. In additional analyses,
Smith [50] showed quantitatively large effects on employment, income, and wealth of new serious health
events. He also demonstrated additional effects of
early life experiences, showing that better childhood
health and family economic environments as reported in adulthood remained significant predictors of better adult health even after controlling for
current health and economic status (see Kawachi, in
this volume).
The clearest demonstration of the effect of SES on
health is in relation to birth outcomes. Infants born
to mothers with less education and less income are
more likely to experience intrauterine growth restriction, be born prematurely, and have a low birth
weight. [51] This disadvantage sets them on trajectories of poorer health, but also of lower adult SES
achievement [49] as childhood illness affects academic
achievement that, in turn, shapes adult SES. [52] Over
the entire lifecourse, as shown in Figure 2, there are
reciprocalinfluences,withSESimpactinghealthand



health impacting success in various SES domains
(e.g., educational attainment, adult occupation and
income, retirement assets).
The second era shone a light on health disparities
along the entire socioeconomic hierarchy and across
the lifespan. It raised questions about the causal direction and the strength of the gradient at different
life stages, and research on these questions continues. At the same time, it raised questions about how
these socioeconomic forces result in poorer health.
These questions became the basis for a third era of
research.


**Third era: mechanisms**


The central questions of the third era of research
revolve around the mechanisms by which SES affects health. What is it about more money, more
education, and higher social class that lead to better health? Increased interest in model development
in the social sciences, methodological developments
from the field of anti-poverty research, [53] and more
sophisticated treatment of the moderator–mediator
variable distinction [54] _[,]_ [55] contributed to this next
evolutionary step toward more mechanistic analyses, building on the more descriptive work done
in the first two eras. The early explanations for
findings of a graded association between SES and
health were of two types. Some researchers, for example, Lynch _et al._, [56] emphasized the importance
of material resources; whereas others, for example,
Wilkinson, [57] noted the contribution of psychosocial factors. These can be seen as competing explanations, but they are not inherently at odds
with one another. The gradient may emerge as the
result of both types of variables and their interaction (see Kawachi _et al_ ., in this volume, for a

fuller discussion). Although it seems likely that material resources would play a particularly important
role among those at the bottom of the SES hierarchy, Lachman & Weaver [58] found low SES individuals with a high sense of control showed levels of
health and well-being comparable with individuals
in higher income groups.
The MacArthur Research Network on SES &
Health was established to identify the mechanisms
by which those who are disadvantaged on the basis
of SES develop poorer health. Investigators from a
range of disciplines joined together to address the
question“Howdoessocioeconomicstatusgetunder
the skin?” (see Adler and Stewart on team science,
in this volume, for a more detailed account of this
process). To frame our research, we first developed
a simplified model to depict the major pathways by
which SES could influence biological processes in
the body (see Fig. 3). The model did not include
feedback loops and interaction effects, because at
this point identifying pathways without these complicating factors was sufficiently challenging. The
examination of interactions awaits the fifth era of



research. The papers that follow describe specific
psychosocial and biological pathways linking SES
and health. Here we briefly touch upon some of
the pathways that are often cited as contributing to
health disparities, including health care access, environmental exposures, health behaviors, and psychosocial and biological processes associated with
stress exposure.
_Differential access to health care_, as noted earlier,
is perhaps the most salient pathway from SES to
poor health in the United States, and is certainly the
one which has received the most popular and scientific attention. Given the lack of universal coverage, those with less income and in occupations/jobs
that do not provide insurance are more likely to be
uninsured. [59] A good deal of research has focused
on the role of unequal access to health care in the
creation of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic health
disparities. Andrulis [60] makes a case for the importance of universal health care in reducing health
disparities through a select review of studies linking
health care access, socioeconomic group, and health
consequences. Interventions that provide more

Health disparities across the lifespan Adler & Stewart



intensive treatment appear particularly effective in
diminishing disparities in outcomes. For example,
a New Jersey initiative to improve birth outcomes
among ethnic minority women found an increase of
almost 56 g in mean birth weight and a 3.7% reduction in the likelihood of having a low birth weight
infant in response to the program which increased
prenatal visits, increased provider reimbursement
and provided post-pregnancy follow-up, case coordination and health education. [61] Similarly, socioeconomic disparities in mortality due to hypertension were eliminated in the Hypertension Detection
and Follow-up Program where all participants, regardless of SES, were provided comparable levels of
care. [62]

In general practice, however, given the features of
our current health care system, simple provision of
health insurance will not eliminate disparities. For
one thing, insurance coverage alone will not assure
equal access and use. Travel time, transportation
availability and cost, scheduling flexibility, sense of
self-efficacy and control, among other factors, all
affect individuals’ capacities to take advantage of
access to medical care. These factors are affected by
SES. In addition, our system focuses primarily on
medical treatment of diseases, not on their prevention. Overall health and longevity are determined
to a greater extent by whether one falls ill rather
than by medical care. Inadequacies of health care,
including lack of access and poor quality of care,
are estimated to account for only about 10% of premature mortality overall. [63] Thus, health disparities
would remain even under conditions of universal
coverage as has been found in England and other
countries with such coverage.
Although not the whole story, health care is still
an important pathway. Frenk [64] notes that while it is
clear that access to health care will not alone eliminate health disparities, it is reasonable to assume
thatitmayworksynergisticallywithimprovedsocial
conditions to provide disadvantaged groups with
better health outcomes.
_Environmental exposures_ are a second pathway
linking SES and health. Environmental hazards and
resources are not randomly distributed. Rather, low
SES communities are subjected to more hazards
and have access to fewer resources to ameliorate
their effects. Recognition of the differential placement of environmental hazards like toxic dumps in
disadvantaged communities gave rise to the envi


ronmental justice movement. [65] The U.S. EPA endorsed environmental justice with the statement
that “no group of people, including racial, ethnic
or socioeconomic groups should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, municipal, and
commercial operations or the execution of federal,
state, local, and tribal environmental programs, and
policies. [65] (pp. 7–8).”
Much of the research documenting unequal exposures to chemical and other toxic substances has
been done outside of the medical domain and there
is limited research on the contribution of environmental exposures to the SES gradient in health. [66]

Existing studies document that exposures to such
environmentalforcesasairandwaterpollution,ambient noise, hazardous waste and toxins such as lead
are socially patterned, with lower SES individuals
having greater exposure. [66]

As with access to health care, environmental exposures are salient to communities, but may play
a limited role in determining health disparities, in
part because of their minor role in determining
health overall. McGinnis _et al._ [63] estimate that the
physical environment contributes only 5% to premature mortality; in comparison they estimate that
health behaviors are responsible for 40% of premature mortality.
_Health behaviors_ contribute to higher morbidity
related to a range of diseases as well as to mortality.
Virtually every health behavior, including smoking,
physical inactivity, and unhealthy diets, is patterned
by SES. Among the health behaviors, tobacco use
accounts for the greatest number of deaths, with
approximately 400,000 deaths a year in the United
States attributed to smoking. [67] Smoking is detrimental to a number of bodily systems, including
respiratory, cardiovascular, and immune systems,
resulting in diseases such as COPD, CVD, and various types of cancer. It is not only individuals who
smoke who bear the negative health consequences,
but also those who live with them. Maternal and paternal cigarette use expose children in the family to
second-hand smoke. Such exposure has short-term
healtheffects,suchasexacerbatingrespiratoryproblems and asthma, [68] as well as setting the stage for
diseases which arise later in life. [69] In addition, parents’ smoking provides a model which may increase
the likelihood that their children will themselves become smokers. [70]

Adler & Stewart Health disparities across the lifespan



Although 40 years ago smoking was equally
prevalent at different levels of SES, today it is more
common among those with less education and income. Those of higher SES had more access to compelling evidence on the link between smoking and
cancer and cardiovascular disease, and to resources
to help them stop smoking. Thus, smoking rates declined far more rapidly at higher SES levels. Differential rates of smoking by SES currently contribute
to health disparities. For example, lung cancer previously did not show an SES gradient but as smoking
became socially patterned, a gradient has emerged
in rates of lung cancer.
SES gradients exist in other health behaviors as
well. The growing obesity epidemic, with its association with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary
heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and several types
of cancer [71–74] is more acute among lower SES populations. Although there are divergent estimates of
the impact of overweight and obesity on mortality, [75]

epidemiologic studies demonstrate a moderate increase in mortality with overweight and a two- to
threefold mortality increase with obesity. Manson _et_
_al_ . [75] conclude that quality-adjusted life expectancy
at age 18 is reduced by 7.2 years for obese women
and 4.4 years for obese men.
Obesity is the result of behaviors involved with
diet and exercise that determine the balance of energy intake and expenditure. These behaviors are
influenced by external factors such as food industry
advertising, the availability of affordable and nutritious food and pleasant recreational areas, and
mandated activities such as school physical education programs. Interestingly, while there is an SES
gradient in obesity, the gap in rates of obesity by
SES is closing somewhat. [76] Rates of obesity are increasing in all segments of the U.S. population, but
rising faster now at higher levels of SES. It may be
that lower SES individuals were “early responders”
to the increasingly obesogenic environment in the
United States. As the rest of the population shows
the effects of this environment, efforts to reverse the
trend may differentially benefit those of higher SES.
If so, as with cigarette smoking; we may see the gap
increase in the future.
_Differential exposure to stress_ constitutes a fourth
pathway between SES and health. This pathway is
less obvious than the others, and the magnitude of
its impact on premature mortality has not been calculated. Stress is defined and measured in a num


ber of ways. Some research, especially that using
an epidemiological approach, focuses on the external threat, or “stressor.” This is generally defined
as an objective event, which requires change or
adaptation by an individual and/or is consensually
judged to have negative impact. The research on
life events uses such an approach. [77] _[,]_ [78] However, observing that not all individuals experience the same
eventasequivalentlythreatening,psychologistssuch
as Lazarus and Folkman [79] define stress as a subjective state that emerges when individuals appraise
a threat as exceeding their resources to deal with it.
Still others define stress in terms of the physiological
indicatorsofactivationofthestressresponsesystem,
including activation of the sympathetic nervous system (or vagal withdrawal) or of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal axis [80] as reflected by changes in
blood pressure, heart rate and heart rate variability,
skin conductance, and cortisol.
Stress has health effects when it exceeds coping
capacities, and especially when it is severe and/or
chronic. Some “stress” can be positive, as when a
challenge is met and results in a satisfying outcome;
such experiences can create a sense of exhilaration,
andofmasteryandcontrol.Ifthethreatitselfcannot
be modified but the individual has sufficient social
and psychological resources to deal adequately with
its emotional impact, stress is negative but not necessarily damaging. In contrast, toxic stress results
when an individual is chronically exposed to uncontrollable stressors, such as a chaotic environment,
abuse or neglect, in the absence of adequate social
or emotional support. Increasing intensity and frequency of stressors interacting with fewer personal
and interpersonal resources can contribute to tolerable stress turning into toxic stress. The chronicity
and severity of stressors play key roles in moderating
the nature and intensity of associated alterations in
immunologic parameters [81] and inflammatory processes. [82] _[,]_ [83] In addition to direct physiological effects
of toxic stress that increase risk for disease, individuals may attempt to cope with these experiences
through health-damaging behaviors.
Research linking stress and health is built on a
strong foundation of basic research on physiological
effects of stress exposure. Much of this research has
been laboratory-based or uses animal models. It has
provided knowledge of the stress response and the
role of stress hormones in regulating the immediate
fight or flight response. [84] Stress has been studied less

often in the “real world.” Lower SES environments
expose individuals to more stressors while simultaneously providing them with fewer resources to
deal with these stressors. These environments increase the likelihood of acute stress exposure and
also contribute to toxic chronic stress. [85] _[,]_ [86]

The stress response is protective in the short term;
it allows an immediate reaction to a threat followed
by reestablishment of homeostasis. However, when
stressors are frequent, over time the constant readjustment of the stress response system may cause
dysregulation in multiple bodily systems. Chronic
levels of stress have been linked to adverse effects including high blood pressure, susceptibility to infection, the buildup of fat in blood vessels and around
the abdomen, and atrophy of brain cells. [87–92] “Allostatic load” provides a useful heuristic model accounting for such changes in response to chronic
stress. [93–95] Allostatic load scores reflect how well
or poorly the cardiovascular, metabolic, nervous,
hormonal and immune systems are functioning.
Higher scores indicate greater dysregulation and
greater vulnerability to disease and predict subsequent onset of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Several studies have shown that allostatic load
scores increase as SES decreases. [96] _[,]_ [97] Work to determine the best operationalization for allostatic load
continues, but the evidence is growing that it captures biological consequences of stress that may help
account for the linkage between socioeconomic disadvantage and a wide array of disease outcomes, and
all-cause mortality (see McEwen and Gianaros and
Seeman _et al._, in this volume).
Evidence of allostatic load resulting from chronic
stress associated with lower SES is consistent with
the view that SES-related exposures contribute
to an acceleration of the aging process. Aging
is associated with the increasing dysregulation of
bodily systems; this natural process appears to accelerate, moving earlier in the lifecourse when individuals are living with greater adversity (see Seeman
_et al._, in this volume). Conversely, a more advantaged life may slow the aging process. Geronimus [98]

suggested a similar process of accelerated aging resulting from social disadvantage in relation to birth
outcomes, which she termed “weathering.” The
weathering hypothesis posits that the poorer birth
outcomes for African-American women compared
to age-matched peers which become more marked
as women enter their 20s and 30s reflects earlier



health deterioration as a consequence of social exclusion. In a recent study, Geronimus _et al._ [99] found
higher allostatic load scores for blacks versus whites
in a nationally representative sample, a result especially marked among those aged 35–64.
Recent studies provide preliminary evidence that
social disadvantage associated with low SES may accelerate aging at the cellular level as indicated by
the length of telomeres. Telomeres, DNA repeat sequences at the tips of chromosomes which act to
protect the chromosome, shorten with age. Below
a critical length, shorter telomeres are associated
with cell senescence and prospective studies have
found that telomere length predicts mortality. [100] _[,]_ [101]

In the first study to link social exposure to telomere length, Epel _et al._ [92] show that both objective
indicators of stress and subjective reports of distress
are associated with shorter telomere length. The association of stress and telomere length remained
significant when adjusted for age, smoking, BMI,
and vitamin use. A study of over 1500 adult female
twins in the United Kingdom showed a link between social class and telomere length. [102] Women in
manual occupational classes based on their own or
their spouse’s occupation had significantly shorter
telomeres than those in nonmanual classes. Part of
the difference was mediated through behavioral factors (e.g., smoking, exercise, and BMI), but significant differences remained when adjusted for these
factors.
While much of the work on mechanisms has focused on adults, some researchers have identified
mechanisms by which SES affects health during
childhood and adolescence. These processes may
set children on different health trajectories that will
affect them over their lifespan. Starting even before
birth, differences in the prenatal environment of babies born to mothers of different social classes can
have lasting health implications. Children born to
mothers with less education and income are more
likely to be born prematurely and be smaller at
birth. [51] Not only do such children have a higher
neonatal mortality risk, but these conditions place
them at greater risk of developing cardiovascular
disease and other problems later in life. [103] _[,]_ [104]

Beyond birth outcomes, experiences in early life
thatshapeinterpretationsofsocialstimulimayserve
as another mechanism by which SES affects health.
Lower SES environments pose more threats and foster more interpersonal conflict. Repeated exposures

Adler & Stewart Health disparities across the lifespan



to such conflictual conditions may create expectancies that establish a lower threshold for perceiving
threat. Expectations of threat may, in turn, increase
the likelihood of negative affect and physiological stress responses. Chen _et al._ [105] found that high
school students from low SES families did not differ from their high SES peers in interpreting clearly
negative stimuli, but were more likely to interpret an
ambiguous situation as threatening. The former had
higher dystolic blood pressure, consistent with their
displaying greater threat responses during ambiguous social situations. Low SES children and adolescents may develop a constantly vigilant stance that
revolves around keeping the self safe, leading to a
state of chronic stress.
The search for mechanistic pathways focuses on
processes operating within individuals to illuminate
psychobiological and behavioral processes by which
SES can affect health. These mechanisms are, however, shaped by the environmental context in which
they arise. Environments affect individuals through
a variety of factors including social encounters that
can impose stress responses as well as supportive
encounters that can reduce them, social norms governing health behaviors, and enhanced or restricted
resources for healthy living. In the next era of research, investigators paid more attention to these
contextual factors of groups or environments to
which an individual belongs, or inhabits.


**Fourth era: multiple levels of influence**


Along with continued research on specific mechanisms at the individual level including cognitive,
affective, and behavioral responses to SES-related
environments by which SES affects biology, work
has evolved in a fourth era to examine mechanisms
operating at multiple levels of influence. This work
has focused on characteristics of the neighborhood
and community as well as of the individual. This
evolution was aided by the application of hierarchical and contextual models developed by statisticians that allow health disparities researchers to use
neighborhood data in new ways. In earlier years,
the socioeconomic characteristics of the neighborhood (e.g., mean income level, percent with college degree, percent unemployed) were sometimes
used as a proxy for the characteristics of individuals residing in those neighborhoods. [106] However,
neighborhoods may affect health through processes



that operate at the neighborhood level, not simply
because the community is composed of individuals
with given socioeconomic resources. Interest developed in the contribution of the neighborhood apart
from the characteristics of the individuals, not as
a marker for them, and, the neighborhood itself
became the focus of interest (see Diez Roux and
Mair, in this volume). These studies have shown,
for example, that individuals living in lower SES
neighborhoods have poorer health related to the socioeconomic characteristics of the neighborhood,
independent of their own SES. [107–109]

Studies in this era have examined the ecological
embeddedness of risk factors for disease that differ by socioeconomic level (see “Clougherty, Souza,
and Cullen, in this volume, for an analysis of the
work environment). A number of these studies have
identified environmental determinants of health behaviors, particularly those that contribute to overweightandobesity.Althoughdescribedasapersonal
behavior, one’s ability to eat a healthy diet and to exercise is affected by resources available to the person.
The availability and relative cost of healthier foods
such as fresh fruits and vegetables varies considerably across communities that vary by SES. Attention
increasingly has focused on the built environment,
with studies documenting more limited availability
of resources in poorer communities [110–112] Low SES
communities often lack supermarkets and residents
are more dependent on convenience markets where
produce is not only more expensive but less fresh
and appealing. These same communities often lack
recreational facilities and their residents may be inhibited from outdoor activities such as walking or
jogging by fear of crime. [113]

The unjust distribution of environmental resources that enable healthy living and hazards that
constrain healthy living contribute to the SES gradient of health behaviors, and hence health. The
fourth era brought greater focus on the social attributes of residential areas and on the built environment. Increased understanding of how SES at
the neighborhood level constrains healthy behaviors emerged in this era and gave rise to the concept
of “behavioral justice.” [114] This perspective argues
that no group should bear a disproportionate
share of health problems resulting from inadequate resources for engaging in healthy behaviors.
Environments dominated by easy access to tobacco
products and alcohol, fast food outlets, scarcity of

affordable and appealing fresh fruits and vegetables,
and unsafe, uninviting community conditions that
restrict physical activity, stack the odds against individualsinthosecommunitiesachievinggoodhealth.
The concept of behavioral justice provides a conceptual link between the individual (behavioral) level
and the social (neighborhood) levels while multilevel analysis allows for empirical evaluation of their
separate effects on health.
While the fourth era added analysis of multiple
levels, the questions were generally framed in terms
of independent effects (i.e., to what extent do neighborhood factors contribute to health independent
of individual factors?). Analyses focused largely on
main effects. Some studies, however, began to look
at the effect of combinations of factors. In so doing
they moved beyond main effects to analyze interactions in the context of multilevel analyses.


**Fifth era: interactions, systems,**
**and causality**


Just as the introduction of the gradient in the second
era added complexity and nuance to the categorical
frameofthefirst,thethirdera’sfocusonmechanism
added detail to flesh out the pathways from SES to
health, and the fourth era added contextual information, research in the fifth era looks not only at
independent associations of different domains but
at how effects are moderated by combinations of
factors.
A variety of interactions are being studied as illustrated by the examples given later.
The interaction of individual and neighborhood
SES is a case in point. In addition to examining
the effect of neighborhood income independent of
one’s own, studies are also asking whether the benefits of living in more affluent communities are similar for those with more and less income and/or
education. Winkleby _et al._ [115] studied 82 neighborhoods in four California cities to examine whether
the influence of individual-level SES on mortality
differed by neighborhood-level SES. Neighborhood
SES was defined by census variables including percent with less than a high school education, median
annual family income, percentage blue-collar workers, percentage unemployed, and median housing
value. Individual SES was defined by educational
attainment and household income. Death rates for
low SES women were highest in high SES neigh


borhoods, lower in moderate SES neighborhoods,
and lowest in low SES neighborhoods. Men showed
a similar pattern, although somewhat attenuated.
These differences in mortality were not explained
by individual baseline risk factors. These results suggest that low SES individuals may not benefit from
the greater resources available in higher SES communities. The stress of having low relative standing
in a high SES neighborhood, and potentially fewer
resources to cope with stressful life events (e.g., social support and low perceived control), may play a
role in the higher mortality of low SES individuals.
Four other studies have examined the cross-level
interaction between individual and neighborhood
SES on mortality, three of which found similar results, [108] _[,]_ [116] _[,]_ [117] while one did not find a significant
cross-level interaction. [118]

Racial/ethnic differences in health may also
be moderated by neighborhood characteristics.
Subramanian _et al._ [119] studied neighborhood variations in poverty and excess mortality. They found
greater racial/ethnic disparities in some neighborhoods than in others, with the odds ratio for Blacks
compared to Whites ranging from 0.31 to 5.36. The
finding that neighborhood level poverty contributes
to greater geographic heterogeneity in mortality
ratesforBlackssuggeststhatneighborhooddeprivation may be particularly impactful for Blacks compared to Whites.
A different approach to understanding the intersection of SES and race/ethnicity is to examine how the effects of SES on health differ among
racial/ethnic groups. For example, among Black and
White men in CARDIA, a longitudinal study of
the development of cardiovascular risk factors in
adulthood, patterns of SES associations with cellular aging differ by race. Using stored blood, Epel
_et al._ (personal communication) are examining socioeconomic differences in telomere length. As discussed earlier, telomeres cap the ends of chromosomes and shorten with age; shorter telomere length
is predictive of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Preliminary results indicate that among White
men, those with less education and lower household income have shorter telomeres and greater
change in length over 5 years. However, SES is not
related to telomere length among African-American
men.
SES gradients in health outcomes among children also appear to differ by racial/ethnic group.

Using data from the National Health Interview
Survey, Chen _et al._ [120] found the usual SES gradients in health for White and Black children but not
for Asian or Hispanic children (see Fig. 4). For example, the prevalence of activity limitations due to
illness drops for Black and White children at higher
levels of parental education. In contrast, there is
little effect of parental education for Hispanic and
Asian children who actually show a small increase in
activity limitations as parental education increases.
These data underscore the importance of looking within each racial/ethnic group when examining the association of SES and health. Doing so is
important not only because of possible interactions
but because current measures of SES do not fully
capture racial differences in socioeconomic position. For example, at the same income level African
Americans have less wealth (assets like savings and
home equity) than do Whites. [29] Wealth provides
a reserve that protects against uncertainty in the
labor market, helps reduce stress on families, and
allows families to live in well-resourced communities. In terms of education, high school graduation
may have a quite different meaning depending on



the quality of the high school, something which often is quite discrepant among different racial/ethnic
communities. New approaches are trying to assess
these differences so that better comparisons can be
made across groups.
In a different domain, researchers are increasingly considering the interaction of individual biology and social context. Boyce and his colleagues
have found interactions between social context and
temperament among children as well as in nonhuman primates. [121] _[,]_ [122] In the Peers and Wellness
Study (PAWS), children were followed through the
kindergarten year to examine the effects of family
SES and of the child’s position in the peer group
social hierarchy on school adjustment. Biological
reactivity was assessed before the start of the school
year in response to social, cognitive, and emotional
challenges. Children from more adverse family environments (e.g., greater financial strain, marital
conflict) exhibited more externalizing behaviors
at the start of kindergarten, whether or not
they showed greater biological reactivity. However,
among children from low-adversity families, the
extent of externalizing behaviors differed between
children with high versus low reactivity, suggesting
agreaterimpactofcontextonthemorereactivechildren.Ontheotherhand,schoolengagementshowed
a cross-over effect with low-reactivity children from
high-adversity families slightly more engaged than
their high-reactivity peers and high-reactivity children from low-adversity homes more engaged than
their lower reactivity peers.
The evaluation of interaction effects is becoming
more common in genetic research, with increasingly
sophisticated work on the gene–environment interaction and on epigenetics. Miller _et al._ [83] show how a
severe chronic stressor, caring for a family member
with brain cancer, influences cortisol-mediated signaling in monocytes, the white blood cells that drive
inflammation. Genes that cortisol usually switches
on were not expressed as strongly in monocytes
from caregivers as were those from non-caregiver
controls, whereas genes that cortisol usually silences
were more active in caregivers than in controls.
This finding suggests a mechanism for how chronic
stress may facilitate the pro-inflammatory gene expression cascade associated with coronary disease,
autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.
Findings by Caspi _et al._ [123] and Taylor _et al._ [124]

show how genetic risk moderates the impact of

Health disparities across the lifespan Adler & Stewart



environmental exposures. Their work has shown
that stress exposure increases the risk of depression primarily among individuals with a genetic
polymorphism associated with vulnerability to depression (a short allele of the serotonin transporter
gene). Those lacking the polymorphism did not experience a greater risk of depression with stress exposure.
Research on epigenetics is introducing further
complexity into our understanding of the interaction of genes and environment. Studies are showing
that environmental context can act upon the gene
itself. Environmental conditions may influence gene
expression and thus change resulting behavioral
and/or biological outcomes. Animal studies conducted by Meaney [125] have shown that early experiences of maternal care or neglect affect offspring in
multiple ways, including their stress-responsiveness
and their later response to their own offspring. Insights from animal models are now being applied to
humans and will provide opportunities to delineate
more precise biological pathways by which social
factors associated with SES affect health.
A few researchers are attempting to study the
kindsofcomplexinteractionslinkingSESandhealth
using systems models that capture nonlinear, dynamic associations [126] _[,]_ [127] These move beyond regression models and simple interactions to capture
interdependent variables that change over time. In
addition to modeling empirical relationships, computer simulations are extending the reach of this
research to predict how policy or environmental
changes might reverberate through a population
and affect health. The greater sophistication of such
analytic and conceptual models may facilitate more
complex and complete understanding of disparities
and of the potential value of different approaches to
reducing them.
During this most recent era, researchers have also
become more concerned about establishing causality. [128] The majority of studies linking SES and health
are cross-sectional, reporting associations between
a given SES indicator and a health outcome and
attributing causality to the SES indicator. These designs cannot rule out alternative explanations, however, including potential endogeneity and reverse
causation. These issues are especially important in
evaluating the relationship of income and health
since poor health entails financial costs and can also
affectone’sabilitytowork. [49] Yetevenwitheducation



which is established earlier in life, causality may flow
in both directions because childhood health problems may limit educational attainment [46] _[,]_ [129] which
in turn may affect health later in adulthood. Increasingly, studies are using longitudinal data and
applying new statistical techniques to explore causal
direction [130] along with novel experimental designs.
Studies involving randomized interventions and
natural experiments such as the Social Security
“notch” [131] and economic change due to reunification in Germany [132] also allow more definitive tests
of causality. While these studies have yielded mixed
results, the preponderance of the evidence continues to support the impact of socioeconomic factors
on health across the lifespan.


**Conclusion**


Each era of research has advanced our understanding of health disparities. In parallel to the unfolding
eras of research designed to increase our understanding of the nature and causes of health disparities, there have been successive eras of thinking about intervention and policy. These, too, have
shown increasing complexity and sophistication [133]

(see Dow _et al._, in this volume). Experimental programs such as PROGRESA (now known as Oportunidades) in Mexico are directly testing innovative
policies. A number of such programs are providing evidence on whether incentive programs are
effective, under what conditions, and for whom.
These parallel advances foreshadow a sixth era of
work on health disparities; one which translates evidence into policy and develops interventions and
evaluation protocols based on the sophisticated understanding allowed by the aggregate of knowledge
accrued across eras of health disparities research.
New conceptual frameworks coupled with more
sophisticated methodologies have allowed increasingly more detailed and nuanced examination of
the realities of the social patterning of health. The
chapters that follow explore where we stand today
in the study of the determinants of health and the
potential for eliminating the unjust disparities in the
capacity of all people to achieve their maximal state
of health.
