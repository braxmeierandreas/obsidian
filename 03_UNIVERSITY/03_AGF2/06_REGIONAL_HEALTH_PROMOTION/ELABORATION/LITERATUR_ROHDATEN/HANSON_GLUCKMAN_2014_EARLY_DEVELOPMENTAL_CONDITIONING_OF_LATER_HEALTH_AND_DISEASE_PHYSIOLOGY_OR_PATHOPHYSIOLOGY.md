10.1152/physrev.00029.2013.—Extensive experimental animal studies and epidemiological observations have shown that environmental influences during early development affect the risk of later pathophysiological processes associated with chronic,
# L especially noncommunicable, disease (NCD). This field is recognized as the developmental origins

of health and disease (DOHaD). We discuss the extent to which DOHaD represents the result of the
physiological processes of developmental plasticity, which may have potential adverse consequences in terms of NCD risk later, or whether it is the manifestation of pathophysiological
processes acting in early life but only becoming apparent as disease later. We argue that the
evidence suggests the former, through the operation of conditioning processes induced across the
normal range of developmental environments, and we summarize current knowledge of the physiological processes involved. The adaptive pathway to later risk accords with current concepts in
evolutionary developmental biology, especially those concerning parental effects. Outside the normal range, effects on development can result in nonadaptive processes, and we review their
underlying mechanisms and consequences. New concepts concerning the underlying epigenetic
and other mechanisms involved in both disruptive and nondisruptive pathways to disease are
reviewed, including the evidence for transgenerational passage of risk from both maternal and
paternal lines. These concepts have wider implications for understanding the causes and possible
prevention of NCDs such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, for broader social policy
and for the increasing attention paid in public health to the lifecourse approach to NCD prevention.

**I. INTRODUCTION: THE DOHaD CONCEPT**


This review is concerned with understanding the physiological and pathophysiological basis for how environmental
influences acting during early human development influence the risk of later chronic, especially noncommunicable,
disease (NCD). This field of biomedical science and public
health has become recognized as the developmental origins
of health and disease (DOHaD) (142, 211). The focus of
this review is to consider the extent to which early conditioning **(TABLE 1)** mechanisms in humans may represent the
physiological processes of developmental plasticity **(TABLE**
**1)** operating in early life, but having potential adverse con


sequences later, or whether they are the result of pathophysiological processes acting in early life but manifesting as
disease later in life. We will argue that the evidence supports
the former concept. The majority of this evidence comes
from animals, but there is increasing evidence from human
physiology which suggests that the concepts have wider
relevance. In addition, they accord with an emerging understanding of the principles of evolutionary developmental
biology (evo-devo) **(TABLE 1)** and evolutionary medicine
(196, 423). We will also discuss how disruptive processes
during development can also lead to later disease, especially
if they are novel from an evolutionary point of view. These
concepts have significant implications for understanding
the epidemiology of NCDs such as type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease and hence for their prevention.
While the end result of these processes is disease in the
modern world, the understanding of the underlying biology
which is necessary if we are to devise preventative measures
includes not only proximal pathophysiological mechanisms
but also more ultimate **(TABLE 1)** mechanistic physiological
considerations. Insights into these can be found in the
broader biological fields of evo-devo (196, 646), and more

**Table 1.** _Definitions of terms used in this review_


**Term** **Definition**


Accommodation Adaptive adjustment, without genetic change, of variable aspects of the phenotype following a novel input
(phenotypic) during development (646)

Adaptive Response (including an effect on phenotype) to a challenge which confers benefit in terms of Darwinian fitness

Assimilation Process by which environmentally induced phenotype may become genetically fixed and no longer requires the
(genetic) original environmental stimulus for its induction (proposed by Waddington, but see Ref. 468)

Canalization Processes constraining effect of changes in genotype (or theoretically small genetic variations) on developing
phenotype (as per Waddington’s epigenetic landscape)

Conditioning A form of “learning” in which a given stimulus becomes increasingly effective in evoking a response or the
response occurs more reliably in a prespecified and stable environment

Disruptive Interference with the normal path of phenotypic development. Environmentally induced severe disruption is
equivalent to teratogenesis; less severe challenges outside the normal range may induce an immediately
adaptive response with longer term consequences

Distal Referring to mechanisms which lead to a condition over a long time period, e.g., related to evolutionary
history

Epigenetic Molecular mechanisms affecting gene expression patterns without alterations in DNA base sequence

Epistasis An interaction between nonallelic genes, especially when one gene suppresses the expression of another

Evo-devo The field of science concerned with the interaction between evolutionary and developmental processes

Fitness (Darwinian) The ability to survive and reproduce; not synonymous with physical “fitness”

Immediately adaptive Developmental (phenotypic) response to a moderately severe challenge, usually outside the normal range,
response (IAR) which promotes immediate survival but may incur longer term disadvantage

Induction Process by which aspects of the developmental environment (including that provided by the mother) alter the
trajectory of phenotypic development of the offspring

Mismatch Difference in the level of an environmental factor which may affect fitness between that predicted on the basis
of developmental cues and that extant later; most commonly applies to nutrition. Developmental mismatch
can occur as a result of inappropriate developmental cues or a change in environment between plastic and
later phases of life, or both; evolutionary mismatch can occur if there is a difference between the extant
environment and that for which the fitness of the species had evolved to be best adapted

Nonadaptive Response (including an effect on phenotype) to a challenge which does not confer benefit in terms of
Darwinian fitness

Parental effect Processes by which phenotypic attributes of the mother (and, less commonly, the father) influence the
development of the offspring. They may confer a fitness advantage, although there is debate over whether it
is in the interests of the mother or offspring (conflict theory)

Pathological Functional changes associated with or resulting from disease or injury; or processes resulting in disease

Physiological Functional processes in the healthy body

Plasticity (not same At the simplest, the ability of one genotype to produce more than one phenotype. Implies morphing from one
as flexibility, low form to another, here through development, and should be distinguished from resilience (the ability to
resilience) withstand challenges with no effect) and flexibility (the ability to “bend” in the face of a challenge, to return to

the previous state after the challenge) (see Ref. 377)

Predictive adaptive Effect of aspects of the developmental environment to induce a phenotype which confers fitness advantage in
response (PAR) this environment. Hence, use of developmental cues to predict or forecast later environment. Prediction
need not be symmetrical in relation to environment, or theoretically accurate in more than 50% of
instances, to have been retained during evolutionary selection (see Ref. 220)

Priming Process by which exposure to an aspect of the developmental environment induces a phenotype which
responds appropriately to a similar environmental challenge later

Programming Term loosely used to refer to relation between early life and later risk of disease, as per developmental origins
of health and disease (DOHaD). Disadvantages of the term are that it implies a predetermined ballistic
course of development and later function rather than plasticity, and that it echoes the genetic program of
development (285) of which it is the opposite

Proximate Referring to mechanisms which lead directly to condition, usually operating in recent past

Reaction norm The range of phenotypes produced from a single genotype in particular environment (654)

Robustness The ability of a phenotype to resist change without changing its initial stable configuration

Teratogenic Effect of an abnormal aspect of the environment to induce pathophysiological changes in offspring; usually
involves exposure to pathogens, chemicals, radiation, and so on

Transgenerational Effects induced in one generation passed to subsequent generations; strictly, to exclude effects mediated via
germ cells in grandmother being manifest as phenotype in grandoffspring, transgenerational effects should
be manifest in great grandoffspring

Ultimate Referring to mechanisms which lead indirectly to condition, usually operating in distant past, e.g., resulting
from evolutionary processes

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



specifically that of maternal or parental effects **(TABLE 1)**
(382a, 417, 599).


While the concept of “parental effects” is widely accepted for
lower animals and some plant species, a wide range of animal
models have confirmed that such processes also occur in mammals, and this has allowed exploration of the underlying physiological mechanisms (for reviews, see Refs. 48, 264, 338,
399). Parental effects are generally considered to operate
within the normative range of environments for a species and
when the effect on the next generation may well have adaptive
value (176). Some influences in one generation may however
have nonadaptive **(TABLE 1)** effects on the next, and this is
more likely in mammals where exposure of the pregnant
mother to an environmental agent may have teratogenic effects on her developing offspring. This distinction between
potentially adaptive parental effects, which are common
across taxa including mammals, and the clearly nonadaptive
consequences of developmentally disruptive conditions, which
are primarily a feature of mammals, is important but is often
not considered in interpreting the experimental and comparative literature. In focusing on this dimension, the present review both builds on previous reviews that have described the
mechanistic insights arising from animal studies, generally
with specific reference to the development of obesity, insulin
resistance, and cardiovascular disease (223, 369, 398) but also
develops concepts related to ultimate causation which emerge
from evolutionary considerations and which may be more
widely applicable. We do not rehearse in detail the physiological processes discussed in earlier reviews, but focus on recent
advances in the elucidation of underlying developmental
mechanisms, particularly epigenetic **(TABLE 1)** processes. This
integration of different fields shifts the focus of our understanding of the processes underlying DOHaD away from
pathophysiology and towards physiology, and provides the
rationale for a greater focus on life-course perspectives in relation to the prevention of NCDs.


NCDs, in particular diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic
lung disease, and some forms of cancer, account for �63% of
all deaths globally (9, 659). Eighty percent of these NCDrelated deaths occur in low and middle income countries
(LMICs), particularly as such countries undergo socioeconomic transition following reductions in the prevalence of
communicable diseases. The greatest burden of these diseases
is currently in Asia, but in the near future, the prevalence will
rise in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central and South
America. The risks of NCDs are exacerbated by Western lifestyle, urbanization, migration, and factors associated with
greater economic prosperity such as nutritional changes and
sedentary lifestyle, all of which produce a “mismatch” **(TABLE**

**1)** between human evolved biology and our contemporary
habitat (205, 212). In addition, demographic changes leading
to increased longevity and smaller family size are shifting the
age distribution of many populations upwards (e.g., Refs. 53,
524), increasing the relative burden of such chronic diseases



further. These issues are central to the consideration of public
health policies in the post-2015 era (600), which will need to
build on the continued efforts aimed at meeting the Millennium Development Goals (662).


The potential economic costs of NCDs are predicted to be
greater than those of communicable diseases, perhaps
equivalent to those of climate change, and approaching
those of a global fiscal meltdown (657). The rising global
challenge of NCDs prompted the special high level meeting
of the United Nations General Assembly in September
2011, at which the importance of developmental processes
was recognized, since “. . .maternal and child health is inextricably linked with NCDs and their risk factors. . .”
(clause 26) (601). This statement represented a substantial
change in public policy focus from the earlier WHO Global
status report on NCDs (659) reflecting the impact of rapid
progress in addressing a number of the conceptual and scientific issues discussed below.


One of the most important risk factors for NCDs is obesity
or overweight, and the problem of the rising burden of
NCDs is often conflated with that of obesity via such neologisms as “globesity” (658) or “diabesity” (146). It is however important to recognize that there are marked population differences in the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the risk of developing NCDs such as type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2D): people of South Asian ancestry
have about three times the risk, and those of Chinese ancestry about twice the risk, of developing T2D at a high BMI
compared with people of Caucasian ancestry (94). These
differences in risk can be seen even at lower BMI.


The currently dominant scientific and public health model
for NCDs assumes that they are a consequence of genetic
predisposition, coupled with adult lifestyle choices that are
largely under voluntary control. However, attempts to reduce the burden of NCDs by promoting weight loss and
changing adult lifestyles have been relatively unsuccessful at
a public health level. Beyond cultural, behavioral, and public policy issues, there are physiological reasons why maintenance of weight loss is difficult. For example, neuroendocrine drivers to sustain hunger and promote food intake
persist following enforced weight loss (573). While attempts to promote a less obesogenic environment must not
be discouraged, it is illogical to ignore the importance of
underlying physiological processes.


If the processes producing propensity to obesity and insulin
resistance are established early in life, then interventions in
adults are likely to come too late to be very effective (209).
Indeed, as Taubes (584) has pointed out, the physiological
basis for obesity, in terms of the physiological control of
metabolism, appetite, etc., has been overlooked in recent
years in favor of a simple energy balance concept: viz. that

obesity arises from excessive caloric intake in relation to
daily energy expenditure. Again, this is too simple a view.


The DOHaD concept emerged over the last two decades,
although there were many historical precedents for it which
were overlooked, partly through declining interest in integrative, and especially developmental, physiology during
the latter part of the 20th century as molecular biology
became dominant (204, 206). There are a range of historical
reasons for the slow acceptance of the concept (see **TABLE 2** )
and, as they form themes which run through this review, we
note them at the outset.


The first issue was a lack of a conceptual framework. The
NCDs which first drew the attention of researchers in the
field were coronary heart disease, hypertension, and T2D.
The dominant paradigm was that these diseases, which develop gradually over many years in adult life, were the result
of lifestyle choices which led to cumulative damage to, for
example, the blood vessels, as a result of repeated exposure
to high levels of glucose, cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, nicotine, and carbon monoxide (CO) from tobacco smoke, etc.
This model assumed that all individuals start life with the
same risk, but diverge only according to their later lifestyle.
The physiological basis for individual or population-based
differences in susceptibility to lifestyle challenges was little
addressed. It was however appreciated that the risk of such
disease had a heritable component in the broadest sense, at
least in terms of ethnicity or family history of disease (577)
but that a substantial part of this was explicable simply as
shared environmental risk. There is limited animal data to
support this concept, although it has been shown that genetically distinct strains of rodents show different susceptibility to features of the metabolic syndrome induced by
maternal dietary restriction in pregnancy (321).


**Table 2.** _Historical reasons for a delay in accepting the_
_DOHaD concept_


**Historical Reasons**


Lack of a conceptual framework

Confusion between factors correlated with disease risk and
those involved in causation

Assumption of operation of a single pathway

Undue focus on low birth weight

Lack of plausible underlying biological mechanisms

Failure to recognize its importance under normal rather
than only under extreme conditions

Lack of evidence of its relative importance in relation to
other risk factors

Lack of plausible ways to use the concept clinically and in
public health


DOHaD, developmental origins of health and disease.



The rise of human genomics was associated with a widely
held conviction that such variation in risk was explicable in
terms of genetic predisposition, specifically small mutations
producing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gene
copy number variation, or other fixed genomic variation.
Whilst some SNPs associated with risk of NCDs have been
found, those associated with large effects in individuals are
uncommon in the population as a whole; the search for
more common variants with smaller effects continues in
larger cohorts and via wider screening across the exome.
The “missing heritability” of chronic disease is still widely
viewed as mysterious (376), but it is now recognized that
the early optimism about finding the genetic basis for
chronic disease was misplaced (303). Moreover, SNPs such
as those in the FTO gene known to predispose to adiposity
show either no (409) or a complex relation with BMI in
childhood (559), so they do not easily account for the lifecourse pattern of risk. As simply summarized by Watson
(635), the contributions of inherited alleles, diet, and levels
of exercise are hard to determine even in common diseases.


As workers in the DOHaD field moved in the last decade
from the study of simple associations between early life
events and subsequent pathology to investigation of underlying mechanisms, new concepts that are central to this
review emerged. The processes we appreciate to underlie
DOHaD are now seen to operate at the interface between
genetic and developmental environmental influences,
largely through the resurgence of interest in epigenetic processes which provide a proximate **(TABLE 1)** explanation.
Even so it required an evo-devo perspective to put this in
context (30, 32, 214, 220, 221) and to place the empirical
observations within a coherent framework. We explore this
further in sections III _C_ and VI _A_ .


The second reason for the slow acceptance of the DOHaD
concept was that the epidemiological observations of an association between early life attributes, in particular birthweight,
and later chronic disease (23, 27) (see below for full discussion), led to the erroneous assumption that such disease processes were initiated during development, when in fact epidemiological observations of this nature can only show correlation, not causation. The intense attention given to
consideration of how low birth weight might lead to disease
(23) was thus misplaced; indeed, it led to consideration of low
birth weight as necessarily lying on the causal pathway. The
relatively low incidence of low birth weight in many populations showing high prevalence of NCDs is evidence that, if it
exists, the role of such a putative pathway is relatively minor.


The epidemiological observations indicated not only that
NCD risk in later life was affected by development, but also
that this risk was graded across the entire range of early
developmental experiences, even when captured by the relatively crude proxy of birthweight or weight at 1 yr of age.
Of key importance, but generally overlooked, was the find

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



ing that this included infants whose birth size was unequivocally within the normal range. Recent studies confirm the
graded nature of the phenomenon, and for a wider set of
processes such as neurocognitive development (623). Other
studies have clearly shown that the long-term effects associated with more subtle changes in the fetal environment
such as variation in maternal nutrition can be independent
of birthweight (185, 229).


As research into what was termed until 2003 the “fetal
origins of adult disease” proceeded, competing theories
arose about the pathways involved (197). While this led to
new insights into developmental effects on tissues, organs,
and systems, the concept that such effects form part of an
integrated physiological response of the organism to developmental signals was not much discussed. For example, a
“mismatch” experiment in which pregnant rats were fed a
restricted diet and their offspring fed a high-fat diet was
shown to affect central nervous components such as appetite control and voluntary exercise capacity as well as peripheral components including body composition, liver metabolism, and cardiovascular function (611, 612). In addition, there is striking consistency in the adult phenotype,
involving multiple physiological systems, in a variety of
animal models where the prenatal or early postnatal environment was altered by a range of nutritional or hormonal
manipulations (397).


The widespread adoption of the term _programming_ did not
help to gain acceptance of DOHaD, because its deterministic implications of “programming of disease” or “programming of function along a pathway” are reminiscent of the
genetic program for development (285). This slowed acceptance of the importance of the normative, holistic nature of
developmental plasticity and its role in affecting sensitivity
to later environments (204). As the essence of the DOHaD
concept lies in the induction **(TABLE 1)** of phenotypic
changes, usually within the normal physiological range,
which permit altered responses to later challenges, usually
also within the normal physiological range, we prefer the
use of terms such as “priming” **(TABLE 1)** (68), “induction”
(29), or “conditioning”: the echo in the latter of the concept
of conditioned reflexes (96) or of conditional growth based
on predicted later nutritional or other conditions is not
unhelpful in this respect.


From the time of early exposition of the “fetal origins of adult
disease” concept, the lack of plausible biological mechanisms
limited acceptance of the idea (125). The long latency of the
effect, from prenatal life to presentation of adult disease over
possibly more than 60 years, was challenging from a mechanistic point of view. In many ways, it was not until the advent
of developmental epigenetics (see sect. III _E_ ) that this particular
challenge was addressed (219). Even so, this has until very
recently limited the application of DOHaD concepts within
clinical medicine and public health and led to misinterpreta


tion of the underlying conceptual model: we will return to this
point in section VI, _D_ and _E_ .


In this review, we first discuss the current state of knowledge
on the epidemiological and clinical physiological observations
that form the basis of DOHaD. Second, to review new understanding of how developmental physiological processes can
predispose to the pathophysiology of NCDs, as opposed to
inducing pathology in early life as implied by earlier theories,
we will consider DOHaD processes from a lifecourse perspective **(FIGURE 1)** . Linked to this is the issue of the ultimate versus
the proximate causation of such effects, and this is considered
in the context of evolutionary and developmental biology.
Based on this, we go on to distinguish between developmental
effects that are potentially adaptive (i.e., physiological; sect.
IV) versus those that are nonadaptive (pathophysiological;
sect. V). We use a strict evolutionary definition of “adaptive”;
adaptive attributes are the result of processes that have been
selected during evolution since they confer an advantage in
terms of survival to reproduce for the individual, more strictly
therefore of Darwinian fitness **(TABLE 1)** The adaptationist
argument can limit understanding if it becomes merely teleological (319): we aim to avoid this, but do not discuss its
limitations in detail here (for more extensive discussion, see
Refs. 217, 220).


Adaptive effects of relevance to DOHaD involve the physiological processes of developmental plasticity and broadly
include the categories of immediately adaptive and predictive or anticipatory adaptive responses **(TABLE 1)** . They can
lead to greater risks of lifestyle-associated disease through
the occurrence of “developmental mismatch” later in the
lifecourse **(FIGURE 2)** . Nonadaptive processes often involve
an element of evolutionary novelty, either because of the
nature of the challenge or because it operates at a level
which in humans exceeds the experience of the hominin
lineage during its evolutionary history; in both instances,
defenses have not evolved to meet the challenge completely.
Nonadaptive processes can therefore lead to an increased
NCD risk even without later mismatch. Examples that we
discuss include those associated with maternal obesity, gestational diabetes, Caesarean delivery, infant overfeeding,
and exposure to toxins, pollutants, or tobacco smoke. Finally, we discuss the implications of this broader understanding of the role of development and the opportunities
which it offers for preventing NCDs and promoting public
health (see sect. VI, _D_ and _E_ ).

**FIGURE 1.** Lifecourse view of noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk. Risk increases
in a nonlinear way as a result of declining

effect of mismatch between developmentally and evolutionarily influenced phenotype
and adult environment also increases
through the lifecourse. Interventions in
adults, especially those at high risk, can be
beneficial, but only to a degree. Screening in
middle-aged adults may also be too late to
reduce risk substantially. Interventions in
adolescents and young adults are likely to be
more effective and, importantly, can reduce
the risk of NCDs in the next generation. The
prenatal period establishes risk through interaction between genetic, epigenetic, and
environmental factors. [Based on the author’s graph prepared for the World Health
Organization (660).]







ancients (e.g., Hippocrates). More recently, Freud (183)
noted the importance of early life in his theories of psychosexual development and was aware that even aspects of
fetal behavior might set the scene for later mental conditions. Critically, a link between poor living conditions in
childhood and later premature mortality was made in 1934
by Kermack et al. (311), and this idea was extended by
Forsdahl (171) who reported that a poor childhood environment was associated with adult cardiovascular disease,
even when the adult environment was not poor, thus focusing attention on development itself as the initiating period.
Dörner and his group (see Refs. 143, 473 for review) studied a range of developmental effects, in particular hormonal
influences on sexual behavior, which became controversially applied to issues such as homosexuality, but his work
also extended to developmental effects on later obesity, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Dörner was the first to use the
term _programming_ (“ _programmierung_ ”) to describe these
effects (323), a term adopted later by Lucas (370), Barker
(22), and many others **(TABLE 1)** (398). Metaphors, while
frequently used in biology, can be problematic if they restrict the challenging of preconceptions (32, 177, 416). The
metaphor of “programming” implies that the complete instructions to carry out a task, e.g., a developmental strategy,
are defined from the outset: this accords more with a computer program than the processes of developmental plasticity. In addition, once running, a program either continues to
completion or crashes. This ballistic model, in which development proceeds to a preset destination, is too deterministic
to describe the observations accurately. As will be discussed, the effects of different developmental trajectories
induced by environmental cues can change the magnitude



(222, 611) and, indeed, sometimes the direction (222) of a
response to a later environment.


Freinkel (182) introduced the term _fuel-mediated terato-_
_genesis_ to describe how prenatal nutrition might produce
effects on subsequent development. While this provided an
important insight by indicating how nutrition might cue
alterations in the development of metabolic homeostasis, as
will be discussed in section III _A_, the long-term effects of
nutritional exposures within the ecologically normal range
during development cannot be viewed as teratogenic, i.e.,
disruptive to the developmental trajectory. Such terms are
not viewed as helpful today.


Experimental studies by van Assche and colleagues in the
1970s (4, 130) first highlighted the long-term consequences
for metabolic control in rats which had experienced developmental challenges (264), but there was a delay of more
than a decade before the broader importance of this work
was appreciated.


The most influential early epidemiological observations in
the DOHaD field concerned the cardiovascular system. In
1980, Higgins et al. (260) reported an association between
pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and the
blood pressure of the offspring as they grew through adolescence: this effect was only seen in the index pregnancy, it
became more exaggerated as the offspring aged, and it persisted after correction for mother’s blood pressure. Higgins
et al. (260) concluded that prenatal environmental, rather
than genetic, effects were therefore involved and suggested
that future research should involve the prospective study of

**FIGURE 2.** The mismatch concept of NCD risk in relation to the

to remain healthy over a wide range of adult environments, at least in
terms of survival to reproductive age (Darwinian fitness). The level of
the environment for health is lower and its range is less following
development in an impaired environment, for example, with low or
unbalanced nutrient provision. If the adult environment is richer, the
risk of NCDs is correspondingly increased. Epigenetic processes are
involved in these developmental effects. Note that predictive adaptive
responses that confer fitness advantage need operate only for a match
between developmental environment and environment up to the time of
reproduction. Any further mismatch, for example, as adult lifestyle
becomes less healthy, adds to the risk of NCDs in ways against which
the developed phenotype may confer little protection. [From Gluckman

women and their children. Interestingly, the effect was more
apparent in male children, and sex differences are now
commonly seen in both experimental and clinical studies
of DOHaD (see sect. IV _B_ ). This prescient study, which
received little recognition, thus predates much later work
in the DOHaD field. Wadsworth et al. (621) subsequently reported an inverse association between birth
weight, parental social status, and systolic blood pressure
in young men and women, and an inverse association
between size at birth and later diastolic blood pressure
was reported for males by Gennser et al. (192). The effects may appear small, but elevations of blood pressure
are known to track from childhood into adulthood and
to predict hypertension (20).


The greatest impetus to the emergence of the DOHaD concept came from the series of epidemiological studies by
Barker [1] and colleagues from 1986 onwards (25–27, 452) in
which links were established between low birthweight,
weight at 1 yr of age, and higher prevalence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and metabolic syndrome in adulthood. Studies which followed confirmed the
association between low birthweight and a range of cardio

vascular disease markers or mortality (173, 350, 385, 500,
546). Barker’s studies arose from the observations that people born in areas of high perinatal mortality, where poverty,
poor diet, overcrowding, and infection led to poor development and early growth, had increased risk of death from
coronary heart disease as adults and that, as in Forsdahl’s
observations, the effect persisted even in those who subsequently moved to more affluent areas. These observations
challenged the widely-held belief that conditions such as
coronary heart disease are solely the result of affluence although, as discussed below, affluence in adult life may contribute to greater risk of disease through “mismatch.”


The relative importance of the developmental component
reported by Barker and colleagues was challenged, for example, in a meta-analysis of available data on the relation
between birth weight and adult blood pressure (275). This
was countered by studies showing that the link is stronger
when the outcome is clinical disease rather than a risk factor
such as blood pressure (114, 115). Much of this confusion
related to the emphasis on birth weight, largely because this
was the only proxy available to assess prenatal development. In addition, the older cohorts, such as those which
Barker studied initially, came from an era when maternal
obesity, gestational diabetes, and fetal macrosomia were
uncommon so the low birth weight relationship seemed
clear. Similarly, survival following extreme preterm delivery or growth restriction was poor, so conflicting effects at
this end of the spectrum from a range of causes were also
removed. As younger cohorts were added, the picture became more complex because maternal obesity and gestational diabetes became important influences on NCD risk in
the offspring, but these are associated with higher birthweight. As will be discussed in section V, these effects probably involve different mechanisms and have different ultimate explanations.


This early epidemiological work was given support by studies of the consequences of historical events such as war,
albeit that they maintained the focus on extreme changes in
the developmental environment rather than on more ecologically normal situations. These studies are not always
easy to interpret as wartime conditions produce changes not
only in nutrition but also in many other factors. Additionally, the timing of the developmental exposure is likely to be
important. During the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944–
1945, food supply to the Western part of the Netherlands
was cut dramatically (with reported daily intake falling to
400–800 calories). Individuals who were in utero, at least
in the later parts of pregnancy during this famine, had a low
birth weight and a decreased glucose tolerance at the age of
50 compared with individuals born the year before or after
the famine (489). Subsequent studies of this population are
inconsistent in relation to whether fetal exposure to famine
was associated with elevated blood pressure in adulthood
(131, 507, 565). In a study of adults born before, during, or

after the civil war in Nigeria (1967–1970), an increased risk
of hypertension was reported in those exposed to war-time
famine during fetal and early postnatal life (273). In contrast, there was no significant difference in blood pressure
between adults who were exposed in utero to malnutrition
during the siege of Leningrad in World War II versus those
who were born at the same time but outside the area under
siege (563). A further example is provided by the Great
Famine from 1959–1961 in China, where one study
showed an association between hypertension following exposure to famine during fetal development (361), whereas
another study did not (270). More recently, Wang et al.
(628) reported that the risk of hypertension was 1.36-fold
higher in those exposed to this famine during only the first
trimester of pregnancy. The risks were 1.83- and 1.31-fold
higher in those exposed only during infancy and in those
exposed during both fetal development and infancy, respectively. One of the problems with such studies is the assumption that the inducing cues are those of malnutrition, when
clearly the population was exposed to considerable stress
and often had substantial changes in the constitution of
their diet as well as its quantity; for example, the Dutch
Hunger Winter diet included unusual items such as tulip
bulbs which may have contained toxins. A further distinction between these famines is that, whereas the Dutch famine was acutely imposed on a previously well-nourished
population and then rapidly relieved, this was not the case
in the other recent historical famines, which emerged gradually and took many months to be resolved.


Notwithstanding the debates about the relative roles of
early life (as measured by birthweight) and adult lifestyle in
the etiology of NCDs, and the rapid increase in the prevalence of NCDs in many populations, the heritable risk of
NCDs has continued to be viewed as largely genetic. Substantial differences between populations in the relation between measures such as waist-hip ratio or BMI and prevalence of diabetes are well-known (e.g., Refs. 94, 395). Such
variations have been assumed to be due to fixed genetic
differences. The original conceptualization of this was
Neel’s (421) proposition of “thrifty genes,” derived from
his studies of the Pima native American people living in the
states of New Mexico and Arizona, who have a very high
incidence of glucose intolerance and T2D even in early
adulthood. Until the mid 20th century their lifestyle involved subsistence farming in a harsh environment, so Neel
(421) proposed that genes associated with metabolic
“thrift,” in particular for insulin resistance, had undergone
positive selection during presumed historical periods of
famine. Confronted with the more abundant and high glycemic index diet of the contemporary United States, such
alleles would confer greater risk of glucose intolerance and
diabetes. Neel’s concept was widely accepted, although
more recently it has been subject to considerable critique
(e.g., Ref. 333). As will be discussed below, fixed genetic
variation which depends on ancestry is not the sole expla


nation for transgenerational **(TABLE 1)** heritable influences
on risk of disease, and there is increasing interest in the
potential for both direct and indirect epigenetic inheritance
as mediators of such influences.


More widespread acceptance of the DOHaD concept occurred following the plethora of studies which replicated
the association between birth size and adult disease, for
ischemic heart disease (325), stroke (500), insulin resistance
and T2D (425, 504). The adult phenotype associated with
lower birthweight includes central adiposity and low skeletal muscle mass (310) reminiscent of the thin/fat neonate
found in India, a country with a high prevalence of both low
birthweight and T2D (666), and there is now substantial
evidence for DOHaD from many populations (223). In addition, very large cohorts have been used to replicate the
concept (46, 188, 304, 325, 344, 500, 608). Lastly, whilst
most epidemiological studies in the DOHaD field have concerned the metabolic syndrome, or its components of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and have relied on birth
weight or infant size as a proxy index of the developmental
exposure, there have been associations found for low birthweight and reduced adult bone density (251), schizophrenia
(427), and asthma and atopic conditions (564). Some of
these observations, for example, for schizophrenia, have
also been linked to the studies of famine (562, 575). There
are also however associations between high birthweight
and some forms of breast cancer (403).


As we have intimated above, the focus on low birth weight
distorted understanding of the underlying phenomena, and it
has only been more recently that attention has shifted from
extremes of birth weight to considerations of how and why
conditioning can operate across all pregnancies and with birth
weights across the normal range. While the epidemiological
studies of Barker and colleagues (23, 25, 26) showed clear
long-term effects on disease risk associated with birthweights within the normal range, the implications of this
have often been ignored. In considering the effects of the
fetal environment for babies with birth size within the normal range, the processes of maternal constraint, which operates in all pregnancies, are relevant (217, 218, 245). Maternal constraint involves a set of uteroplacental mechanisms by which fetal growth is restricted from reaching its
genetic potential, necessary to permit successful passage
through the pelvic canal at delivery. Maternal constraint is
greater in mothers of short stature, in adolescents, and in
primigravida, as the pelvic canal is smaller in such pregnancies (215, 607). Two recent studies have now shown that, in
terms of perinatal survival, optimal birthweight is considerably higher than the mean birthweight for the population
(180, 607). Mechanistically, even some appropriately
grown fetuses show signs from Doppler ultrasonography of
being challenged (410), although whether this is the consequence of maternal constraint is not known.

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



Thus in recent years a shift has been made from the study
of the long-term effects of extremes in birthweight to that
of cohorts of apparently normal pregnancies. For such
studies, accurate measures of gestational age are necessary, as both growth and length of gestation can be influenced by environmental factors that can make the
most widely used methods of ultrasound dating inaccurate (295). Effects of maternal diet and body composition
within the normal range of fetal growth have been shown
on liver blood flow, ductus venosus shunting, and fat
deposition in the fetus (313). There are additional effects
on hepatic (151), celiac, and splenic (149) arterial hemodynamics and on the portal venous (150) and the intrahepatic circulation (312). There are a few studies (e.g.,
Ref. 227) on the postnatal sequelae of these fetal patterns
of development, but more are needed. Mechanistic studies, for example, those of alterations in vasculogenesis in
low birthweight infants (364), need to be extended to
cover the normal range.


**B. Conditioning by Overnutrition**


It has only relatively recently been realized that the DOHaD
concept also operates in the context of a prenatally or neo


natally excessive or rich nutritional environment (13, 481,
638). Early evidence of this comes from the 1946 United
Kingdom birth cohort (247), from the Pima native American population (465) and from the meta-analysis of the
Nordic cohorts (188) which show a U-shaped relation between birth weight and blood pressure **(FIGURE 3)** . More
recently, both maternal obesity and gestational diabetes
mellitus (GDM) have been implicated in leading to a later
risk of obesity and cardiometabolic disease risk in the offspring (343, 498). There are also reported associations between excessive weight gain in pregnancy and offspring
blood pressure and adiposity (181, 191, 379).


A range of epidemiological studies have shown effects of maternal prepregnancy BMI on offspring’s blood pressure or autonomic function (156, 169, 446, 645). Maternal obesity is
associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications including hypertension, preeclampsia, and GDM, and a child of
an obese mother is also more likely to become obese (85, 649)
and to develop asthma and atopic disorders such as dermatitis
(248, 349, 470). Offspring’s adiposity at age 4 is related to
mother’s BMI across the entire range from very thin (BMI
�18.5) to obese (BMI �40) (649). While the data are less
robust, there is the suggestion that infant feeding with formula

(which tends to be more calorie-dense and for which intake
can be more directly driven by parental behavior than by infant demand) rather than human breast milk also conveys a
greater risk of later obesity (12, 568, 616).


An increasing concern is the transmission of risk of diabetes
across generations. An increasing number of women develop T2D during their reproductive years (168, 493) and
children of type 1 or 2 diabetic mothers are more likely to
become obese and to develop diabetes (479, 541). The effect
on the offspring is related to intrauterine exposure to hyperglycemia because, among siblings, the risk of diabetes is
greater in those born after the mother developed diabetes
(116). In turn, the incidence of GDM is rising rapidly in
many countries, particularly in Asia (168, 374), and the
offspring of gestational diabetics have been shown to have
both a greater risk of developing obesity (540) and insulin
resistance. While the focus here has been on the clinical
condition, again the data show evidence of effects occurring
across a range, as even offspring exposed to mild hyperglycemia during pregnancy have increased lean and fat mass
and greater risk of diabetes (246, 578). The problem of
“diabetes begetting diabetes” is thus of major concern (374,
667).


**III. HOW ORGANISMS RESPOND TO THE**
**DEVELOPMENTAL ENVIRONMENT**


**A. What Is “Normal” Development:**
**Disruption Versus Plasticity**


The term _plasticity_ **(TABLE 1)** has different connotations in
different contexts. We favor Malabou’s (377) distinction
between plasticity, which involves a change in phenotype
from one condition to another, versus resilience in which
the phenotype does not change in the face of a certain range
of challenges, and flexibility in which a challenge produces
some change but a return to the original state when the
challenge is removed. The concept of developmental plasticity is based on the understanding that the phenotype and
genotype do not have a fixed relationship and that the phenotypic attributes of individuals are affected by developmental processes (32, 646). Such differences exist even between monozygotic twins (560) and in asexually reproducing species isogenic clones can show environmentally
induced variation, for example, in crayfish genetically identical individuals show variation in body markings, growth,
and reproduction (614). Such developmentally induced
phenotypic variations are normative, and the adaptive advantage of the conservation across evolution of the processes of developmental plasticity has been discussed extensively (499, 671). While there may be some stochastic elements, particularly within species with very high reproductive
rates such as asexually reproducing bacteria (40), in the context of more slowly reproducing mammalian species such as



the human the emphasis needs to be on the relationship
between environmental influences and the consequential
phenotypic change which, as will be discussed below, has
directional components of potential adaptive value. Indeed,
the importance of including the life history strategy of the
species in considerations of developmental plasticity cannot
be overemphasized (382a). The nature of developmental
responses to environmental cues is greatly influenced by the
reproductive strategy of the species (382a) and, in particular, on the effects on parent or offspring fitness. With this in
mind, in the following discussion we focus only on responses relevant to the human.


While environmentally induced developmental plasticity is
an evolved and normative process, many external environmental influences can be said also to “disrupt” development
(30, 193, 221). Such use of the word _disrupt_ is appropriate
when the agent produces a somatic mutation with phenotypic consequences, or leads to a toxic effect that disrupts
the normal pattern of development. Many teratogens are
known: most are evolutionarily novel substances such as
thalidomide or synthetic steroids, others are infective agents
such as rubella, and still other disruptions involve gross
deficiencies of micronutrients such as folate or gross excesses such as of vitamin A. For each of these examples we
can assume that they were sufficiently uncommon in the
evolutionary past for the hominin lineage not to have
evolved effective defenses against the developmental disruption they can cause. Likewise, the loss of the ability to
synthesize vitamin C in primates is not associated with detrimental antioxidant effects when the micronutrient is plentiful in the diet (44). It can however be argued that phenotypic accommodation **(TABLE 1)**, i.e., phenotypic responses
to the disruption, can allow survival and thus have some
adaptive **(TABLE 1)** potential (32).


The distinction between developmental plasticity and developmental disruption is not just semantic (207). It has important
conceptual and mechanistic implications, viz. that plasticity is
an evolved response aimed at enhancing fitness, while disruption is a passive response that in general impairs fitness. However, some cues can exert either a plastic or a disruptive influence depending on their magnitude (30) in a dose-dependent
manner. For example, mild hyperglycemia in utero changes
the rate of growth and has adaptive potential (see below), but
more severe hyperglycemia can disrupt cardiac development
leading to congenital heart anomalies (510), and derangement
of maternal lipid profile can also lead to increased risk of
congenital heart disease (552).


**B. Development in Individuals and**
**Populations: Inheritance and Heritability**


In moving from consideration of individuals to populations, the concept of variation in phenotype becomes important, because this is one of the necessary prerequisites

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



for Darwinian (both natural and sexual) selection. It was
soon realized that the variation in most characteristics does
not follow Mendelian rules of inheritance (see Provine 1971
referred to in Ref. 468), so the underlying processes must be
more complicated than simply random allocation of genetically determined characteristics. Selection operates on the
phenotype, not the genotype, but it is the latter that changes
through evolution. The range of phenotypes which a particular genotype can produce in a particular environment is
termed the “reaction norm” **(TABLE 1)** (654).


It is important to remember that inheritance is a much
broader concept than genetic inheritance. The traditional
breeder’s equation of population genetics assumes independent genetic and environmental factors (39), and measures
of heritability attempt to describe how much variation in a
particular trait in a population is accounted for by genetic
variation. But such measures depend on the environment in
which the population resides **(FIGURE 4)** (357). For example, height has a lower heritability in populations where
childhood nutrition is variable, leading to environmentally
induced stunting in some children who are not well nourished. If the genetic determinants of heritability are low,
then classical models of selection have less explanatory
power with respect to the evolution of the phenotype. These
arguments and others have led to the concept that the multiple processes of plasticity itself may be subject to the processes of evolution (337) and that they evolved because they
confer a fitness advantage (32). While beyond the focus of


**A** **B**


**C** **D**



this review, there are also some data showing that, under
some conditions, plastic changes in the phenotype can become genotypically fixed (assimilated) and thus incorporated into evolutionary processes (32, 646).


For much of the past 100 years it has been assumed that
there are only two kinds of inheritance: genomic and
cultural. However, in recent years there has been an explosion of interest in three other forms of inheritance.
The first concerns maternal (or paternal) effects, the subject of much of this review, by which the environment in
one generation can condition the phenotype of the next,
and possibility subsequent, generations. The second, related concept concerns indirect epigenetic inheritance
whereby maternal effects induce epigenetic changes in
the offspring of the next generation and in turn these
epigenetic effects recapitulate the maternal phenotype
which induced them; thus the offspring themselves induce the same maternal effects in the next generation,
and so on (218). This scenario is most well demonstrated
in studies of female rats with high versus low grooming
behavior towards their offspring (637) where the indirect
nature of the inheritance has been demonstrated from
cross-rearing experiments. Third, recently a body of evidence has suggested the potential for trans-meiotic epigenetic inheritance (see Ref. 283 for review) including
that from experimental studies in rodents (239, 240, 428)
and compatible human observations (462, 463).

is genetic variation, plasticity, and variation
for plasticity. In addition, in _D_, the heritability (extent of variation of phenotype in a

genetic variation) of the trait is lower at the

In the context of this review, the transgenerational transfer
of the gut microbiome and its potential longer term consequences illustrate the importance of taking a broader view
of inheritance. Mice reared in a germ-free environment are
protected from dietary-induced obesity (18). Breast-fed and
formula-fed infants have different patterns of gut microbiota, and while the data has been challenged (326), there is a
body of evidence suggesting that breast feeding is associated
with a lower risk of obesity. There is also a relation between
how the gut is colonized depending on the mode of delivery
(vaginal/caesarean) (598) and different disease risks in children. Those born by caesarean section have a higher rate of
types 1 and 2 diabetes (81) and allergy.



**C. Developmental Plasticity and**
**Canalization: Developmental Constraints**
**Versus Sources of Phenotypic Variation**


There are multiple processes of developmental plasticity
acting at various levels of organization to produce phenotypic variation. Equally there are multiple mechanisms restricting developmental variation, and so inducing robustness **(TABLE 1)** in the phenotype. These should not necessarily be seen as opposing processes as they reflect integrated
mechanisms to optimize the outcomes of development from
an adaptive perspective (for review, see Ref. 32).


There are two important points regarding how these processes work together to enhance fitness. The first is the
relative robustness of the developmental “program,” such
that individuals with phenotypic traits of proven evolutionary fitness reproduce this reliably in each generation despite
variations in the individual developmental conditions. The
second is the ability to respond to changes in such conditions within the normal range, to produce a degree of phenotypic variation through developmental plasticity. Just as
for the first process, the second confers a fitness advantage
and has thus been preserved through evolution. As the fitness advantage is reflected in the ability to survive to reproduce, it can be manifest at any stage of the lifecourse up to
peak reproductive potential, starting from early development. Whyte (650) coined the term _internal selection_ to
explain how effects on the early embryo would be more
likely to have dramatic effects than later challenges and so
some might be deselected, although at that time the idea
was couched in terms of the lethal effects of mutations.


Of the mechanisms seen as conferring robustness, the best
recognized is that of canalization, which permits maintenance of a phenotype in the face of variations in the environment or genotype. Canalization is often associated with
the theoretical and empirical work of Conrad Waddington,
who coined the term _epigenetics_ in about 1942. His wellknown epigenetic landscape **(FIGURE 5)** shows not only how
developmental processes are canalized to buffer against
variations in genotype and certain developmental expo


**FIGURE 5.** Waddington’s “epigenetic landscape.” In contemporary
terms, the ball may be viewed as a group of pluripotent stem cells,
for which the final destination in terms of final committed cell line
depends on the path selected at a series of bifurcations. In Waddington’s model, phenotypic development is “canalized” by processes
which restrict its variability in the face of variation in genotype. Such
processes are essential for replication of the lineage. Processes
that reduce the steepness of the walls of the valley therefore increase plasticity. [From Waddington (619). Reprinted by permission
from Macmillan Publishers Ltd.]


sures (the steepness of the walls of the valleys representing
the degree of canalization) but also that epigenetic processes
can induce switches in a developmental pathway, for example, to induce different cell types from a pluripotent stem
cell line, or at the organism level to induce a different morph
in a polymorphic species.


From a physiological point of view, it has been proposed
that canalization **(TABLE 1)** utilizes processes controlled by
factors including heat shock protein (HSP) 90, at least in
some species (407), and HSP90 has been suggested to act as
a “capacitor” to alter the degree of buffering of phenotypic
effects (483). In rodents, the transgenerational passage of
changes in the expression of the metabolic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and increased
PPAR�and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 expression, induced by a sustained switch to a higher energy diet, were
accompanied by changes in HSP90 expression and epigenetic changes (70). HSP90 acts a chaperone for a wide range
of genes and can modulate effects of steroid hormones (512)
that are known to be involved in developmental conditioning.


The term _genetic accommodation_ is sometimes used to reflect the processes of phenotypic canalization that act to
reduce the impact of randomly occurring genetic mutations
(646). Such buffering may prevent their affecting the phenotype, but they can remain in the genotype as cryptic genetic variations (195) that may become manifest in later
generations under different circumstances. For example, in
the classic experiments of Belyaev using the wild silver fox,
where animals were selected artificially on the basis of reduced fear of humans, cryptic variation in a number of

phenotypic features appearing early in development, such
as coat color as well as head and ear shape, was exposed
(596). Presumably the selection on aspects of familiarity
with humans had epistatic **(TABLE 1)** effects reducing the
degree of canalization of coat color and other morphology
in the offspring.


**D. The Temporal Dimension of**
**Developmental Responses to**
**Environmental Change**


Developmental plasticity can also be placed in the context
of different time scales of environmental change (measured
with respect to the intergenerational period of a species)
(332) (see **FIGURE 6** ). The most rapid response of an adult
organism to a change in its environment constitutes physiological homeostasis, operating to achieve constancy of the
milieu interieur (235). This operates over a time scale of
seconds to hours and involves changes in metabolism, cell
signaling, and neuroendocrine responses. At the other temporal extreme, natural selection acts to change the genotype
of a lineage in response to a sustained shift in the environment acting over many generations. Developmental plasticity occupies an intermediate position between these two
extremes. It allows an organism to change its phenotypic
development from that of its evolved lineage in response to
an experienced or anticipated environmental change, but
where the change is neither consistent over generations nor
sufficiently prolonged to induce evolutionary change. The
presence of maternal effects allows such plastic responses to
persist over more than one generation but not to be sustained indefinitely in subsequent generations if the environmental shift is not permanent. The fitness advantages of
such an intermediate response to environments which fluctuate over a longer time base than the generation time is
apparent (334).

Darwin’s cousin Francis Galton (187). It was such concepts
that paved the way for the eugenics movement in the first
part of the 20th century and which continued into the postwar years (243). Following the rise in the science of genetics, “nature” became associated with heritable genetic traits
and “nurture” with environmental or cultural influences,
especially those operating during childhood. Unfortunately,
the debate persists even today, with widespread belief that it
is possible to separate the genetic from the developmental
environment component of many traits, including disease
susceptibility (308). Increasingly, our understanding of development shows the artificial nature of the distinction and
the limitations of attempting to separate genetic and environmental influences, because they interact continuously
across the lifecourse.


Furthermore, the concept of the gene as a physical entity in
the process of the Central Dogma (111) is now seen to be
flawed; indeed, “gene” now has varied and quite different
definitions (415). Genes can be defined as segments of
DNA, that is as structural elements, or alternatively as functional entities, although this depends on what definition of
function is used (32, 416). The problem has become evident
most recently in the current debate over the interpretation
of the ENCODE data (152), in the sense that “intergenic”
regions formerly thought to be “junk” DNA with little
functional importance were shown to be potentially expressed, even if their functions remain unknown. In turn,
the functional operation of a gene, and indeed its definition
according to some interpretations, involves considerable input and influence from the environment. As Fox Keller has
pointed out (308), the idea that the two processes of nature
and nurture are distinct is neither helpful nor correct. The
ways in which integrative physiological thinking is challenging the fundamental tenets of neo-Darwinism as enshrined in the Modern Synthesis (274) has recently been
elegantly described (433). In some respects, this indicates a
return to Bateson’s definition of genetics as “the physiology
of descent” (35).


The essential role of development in phenotypic variation
was widely recognized by the early 20th century Russian
school of biologists, as exemplified by the writings of
Schmalhausen (523). Unfortunately, these were appropriated, misapplied, and then suppressed by Lysenko. In the
Western world it was the work of Waddington (619), perhaps influenced by Schmalhausen, that placed similar emphasis on this concept. Waddington introduced the term
_epigenetics_ at a time when the underlying molecular mechanisms were unknown. It was only with the more recent
understanding of the molecular basis of epigenetics that the
importance of these early scholars’ work was recognized.


There is now a plethora of reviews on the part played by
epigenetics in phenotypic development (228). The majority
of studies have focused on DNA methylation acting at CpG

base pairs although there is growing interest, especially in
cancer biology, in effects on the covalent modification of
histone protein tails, which affects DNA compaction (74),
and on the role of noncoding RNAs (400). One source of
confusion is the very different biological roles which epigenetic mechanisms play, even leaving aside their role in the
pathological **(TABLE 1)** processes of cancer; for example,
during evolution the epigenetic mechanisms which control
gene expression under normal circumstances appear to
have been coopted to regulate gene dosage (497). Thus the
term _epigenetics_ can encompass very distinct biological processes including transposon silencing, cellular differentiation (essential for the evolution of metazoa), chromosomal
silencing in sex determination, and the imprinting of alleles
depending on parental origin which evolved in marsupials
(496) but is also found in plants (389). Epigenetic inheritance has been shown over eight generations in _Arabidopsis_
(293). Between the appearance of metazoa and marsupials,
the same biochemical pathway has been coopted to serve
several quite disparate functions. Adaptive developmental
plasticity, which is present in species as widely different as
_Daphnia_ and humans, and is the physiological mechanism
of central interest for this review, is another distinct class of
epigenetic function (216).


DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation affect gene expression by altering the access of transcription factors,
which may then either augment or repress transcription, or
through promoting the binding of the methyl CpG-binding
proteins to methylated cytosines which recruit histonemodifying complexes to the DNA. These include histone
acetyltransferases (HATs), which add acetyl groups to the
histone tails and make the chromatin transcriptionally active, and histone methyltransferases (HMTs) such as
Suv39H, which methylates lysine 9 on H3, and produces a
closed chromatin structure and silencing of transcription.
Most studies have examined such methylation across large
regions of the genome, sometimes called differentially
methylated regions (DMRs) (167), or at major clusters of
CpGs called CpG islands and shores. However, these different patterns of CpG distribution have distinct biological
roles that are only now being elucidated (570), an example
being the role of DMRs in determining cell differentiation
(318).


Recent evidence however stresses the importance of examining methylation at individual CpGs and patterns of methylation in small genomic regions (229). Methylation of
CpGs de novo is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) 3a and 3b, which remethylate parts of the genome after
the widespread demethylation that occurs following fertilisation (412). The pattern of DNA methylation is then maintained through mitosis by methylation of hemimethylated
DNA by Dnmts. DNA methylation patterns induced during
development were originally thought not to change greatly
later, except in epimutations associated with cancer (138),



but are now known to be fundamental to the processes of
developmental plasticity. In monozygotic (MZ) twins, epigenetic variability increases with age (655), and this change
is affected by lifestyle (178). DNA methylation differences
are apparent even at age 5 yr in MZ twins (655). Thus,
while the epigenome is most flexible from the perspective of
developmental plasticity in early life, some degree of flexibility extends well after birth.


There is now evidence that environmental cues can alter
patterns of DNA methylation in the embryo (316), and this
is of relevance to the observations of an apparent increased
incidence of imprinting disorders in children conceived using assisted reproductive technology (ART) (110, 133, 316,
451; for review, see Ref. 604). There is also evidence that
ART can lead to long-term phenotypic effects in the offspring including greater risks of obesity, insulin resistance,
and hypertension (250).


In addition to the processes of methylation which produce
5-methylcytosine (5mC), there are also well-regulated demethylation processes, for example, TET (ten-eleven-translocation) which catalyzes conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (279, 663, 664) which may
be an intermediate in the removal of 5mC. As 5hmC levels
across the genome are low, it may be short-lived, or it may
act as another epigenetic modification, inducing chromatin
and transcriptional modifications. The distribution of
5hmC relative to 5mC (664), and its presence at exons
strengthens the idea that it is associated with gene expression.


There is a high degree of specificity in the processes of DNA
methylation despite the small number of methylation-related enzymes involved. It is assumed that specificity is conferred by microRNAs acting in concert with these enzymatic processes, but this is poorly elucidated. A further
complication is the phenomenon of allele specific methylation whereby a SNP may impact on the pattern of methylation in a CpG _cis_ to that SNP (538). The underlying mechanism may relate to the capacity for that SNP to affect small
RNA production. It is thus important to use advanced
bioinformatic techniques to identify methylation changes
that are responsive to the environment and additionally
those that are secondary to a fixed genetic mutation.


Some epigenetic processes, and particularly those related to
developmental plasticity, are susceptible to nutritional influences, in part because processes such as DNA or histone
methylation require a source of methyl groups from 1-carbon metabolism. These are not usually in short supply in the
diet and can be derived from the nonessential amino acid
glycine. However, the demands for this in the late gestation
human fetus are such that glycine becomes a conditionally
essential amino acid. Animal studies show that the phenotypic effects on the offspring of a maternal low-protein diet

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



can be prevented by supplementation with glycine (64,
284). Folate is also required for the provision of methyl
groups, and this is largely derived from the maternal diet.
Folate plays a major role in many aspects of fetal developmental (606) pathways via epigenetic mechanisms (238),
and imbalance can lead to the accumulation of homocysteine, which has damaging effects on many organs including
the kidney and cardiovascular system and which can act via
increased oxidative stress (641).


In rodents, folic acid supplementation of the low-protein
diet fed to the dam prevents epigenetic and phenotypic effects on her offspring (365), and paternal dietary folate level
produces epigenetic effects in sperm and affects pregnancy
outcome (336). Provision of methyl group donors in the diet
also prevents the induction of epigenetic effects via retrotransposons in the agouti mouse (630). In humans, dietary
supplementation with folic acid is known to reduce the risk
of neural tube and other “congenital” defects (127), and the
balance between folate and vitamin B12 status is linked to
diabetes risk (668). The critical period when epigenetic
changes can be reversed by folic acid supplementation is not
known, although in rodents it may extend into the
postweaning prepubertal period (72).


Nutritional influences on the developmental epigenetic
state are however broader than specific influences on onecarbon metabolism. Taurine has long been considered to be
an important factor (5), and recent studies implicate its
deficiency in endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress (36a), which
can have a range of downstream effects, including on sirtuins and ageing (92). Given that epigenetic mechanisms
underpin developmental plasticity and that nutritional cues
are important with respect to adaptive developmental plasticity, it is to be expected that a variety of nutritional cues in
development will have specific epigenetic consequences.
Most experimental studies of nutritional effects on the offspring have used an unbalanced maternal diet with a low
protein-to-carbohydrate ratio or a global dietary restriction
during pregnancy. However, unbalanced diets with high
levels of dietary fat or cafeteria diets simulating the Western
“junk food” diet have also been explored (38, 39).


Epigenetic effects on the developing offspring can also be
induced by altered maternal behavior. Offspring of rat
dams that exhibit high levels of licking and grooming were
shown to have lower levels of methylation at specific CpG
dinucleotides within the hippocampal _GR_ promoter, concomitant with higher expression of the gene product which
regulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity (636).
These offspring were better able to cope with stressors in
adulthood, demonstrating a functional link. Maternal caredependent gene expression changes in the hippocampus
could be reversed by intracranial administration of the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A and L-methionine,
which acts as a methyl donor (637).



As Ozanne has pointed out (e.g., Ref. 147), the regulation
of transcription factors by epigenetic processes is an effective way of altering the developing phenotype via manipulation of physiological control processes: examples include
effects on RXRA (229), Pdx1 (458), and Hnf4� (518).


Prenatal epigenetic effects are not confined to the developing fetus. Some effects are mediated by epigenetic processes
in the placenta, for example, at the level of amino acid
transporters (352) and imprinted genes that in some species
affect fetal growth (177, 294). There may also be effects on
glucose transporters (298). The interaction between fetal
growth and placental vascular function via the NO system
appears also to be mediated in part by epigenetic processes
(328).


From a physiological point of view, it is now important that
a range of processes have been discovered which affect gene
expression and thus phenotype beyond structural mutations such as SNPs. In addition to the processes discussed
above, we should note gene copy number variations, the
occurrence of which in the offspring can also be affected by
maternal diet (75). Evidence that epigenetic processes can
affect the probability of mutations through the hypermutability of CpG sites should promote greater acceptance of
the previously heretical notion that physiological processes
can affect the genotype; this idea has implications not only
for developmental but for evolutionary biology (434). Finally, it is now becoming clear that studies of developmental conditioning will require measurement of the interaction
between genetic and epigenetic processes.


**F. Developmental Strategies**


As Hertzman has summarized (259), there are several ways
of thinking about DOHaD phenomena. In practice, they are
hard to separate. One, which accords with the concept of
critical periods in development (see also Ref. 330), proposes
latent effects whereby early life environment produces effects on later health and disease risk independently of intervening environmental influences. This has similarities with
aspects of neural development, such as the visual system,
but less so with cardiometabolic control. The second involves pathway effects, whereby the response to a cue at a
particular point in time depends on the developmental pathway leading to that time, and this is currently the most
favored explanation. The third possibility uses a cumulative
effects model for the detrimental consequences on health of
repeated and graded exposure to adverse environmental
conditions. While this concept is incorporated into current
DOHaD thinking (see **FIGURE 1** ), on its own it does not
differ from the damage accumulation/adult lifestyle model
that does not account for the demographic patterns of disease. For example, although the prevalence of obesity has
continued to rise in most countries over the last years, there
has been a steady decline in global mean blood pressure,

and interventions to reduce blood pressure, glucose, and
cholesterol account for only 50% of the excess risk of coronary heart disease (201).


The phenotype emerging from the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, and mediated via epigenetic processes, will be adaptive if aspects of the phenotype
induced affect either the individual’s survival until reproductive age, or reproductive capacity and fecundity.
Strictly, fitness is measured in terms of the number of viable
offspring which themselves reach reproductive age, or better the number of resulting grand-offspring. Simple examples can be found in egg-laying species including fish, birds,
and insects, where environmental factors such as nutrient
availability or number of predators affect both the number
of eggs laid and their size, which in turn influences the
survival chances of the offspring (155). We can see that
there may be a potential conflict here between maternal use
of food resources for metabolism and investment in the
fitness of the next generation (this concept of maternaloffspring conflict is discussed in sect. IV _D_ ). In addition,
mechanisms which evolved to confer fitness may not have
the same effects in contemporary conditions (34, 591).


The role of maternal effects or, where there is also an influence of the father, parental effects and their evolutionary
significance has been reviewed (382a, 599). They can be
quite dramatic in terms of the offspring phenotype induced.
East African grasshoppers that are normally green develop
into a black morph after a grassland fire (509). Another
excellent example is the desert locust ( _Schistocerca gre-_
_garia_ ). This species has two distinct phenotypes (or
morphs): solitary and migratory. They differ dramatically
in terms of behavior, with the shy, nocturnal, solitary form
contrasting with the gregarious, diurnal, migratory form; in
nutritional physiology, with the solitary form having a restricted range of food plant species whilst the migratory
form is far more omnivorous; and in metabolism, with only
the migratory form being capable of long flight. The morph
that forms following larval hatching is influenced by the
environmental conditions. A high population density affects the composition of the secretion produced by the
mother around the eggs, and it is this chemical stimulus
which influences the phenotype, inducing the migratory
morph which is more likely to move to a less well-populated
area (392). An equivalent mammalian phenomenon has
been reported in the red squirrel, in which high population
density and low food abundance produces a glucocorticoid
response in the mother which is associated with accelerated
growth in the offspring (120), permitting them to reach
reproductive age more quickly.


The direct role of nutrition as an inducer of phenotype in
the developing offspring is exemplified by the honey bee
( _Apis mellifera_ ) where the maturation of the female larva
into a queen versus a worker can be produced by feeding it



exclusively on royal jelly for a longer period: the active
component in the royal jelly responsible for this induction is
not known, but the polyphenism is mediated by epigenetic
mechanisms as it can be altered by use of an siRNA to
suppress Dnmt3 activity (329).


It is not known whether such polyphenisms are relevant to
mammals. We have argued that there is some evidence in
the rodent for developmental bifurcations in response to
maternal nutrition which might suggest an echo of distinct
morphs (222). Furthermore, the distinct forms of response
of children to severe undernutrition, which have different
adaptive consequences and which appear to originate prenatally, suggest that some aspects of human physiology do
not follow a continuous reaction norm but may be discontinuous, reminiscent of polyphenism (170). However, in
mammals, most developmental plastic responses do produce a continuous reaction norm (522), for example, in
linear growth, birth weight, gestational length, or metabolic
function. The upper and lower limits of that reaction norm
are limited by various tradeoffs; for example, gestational
length is limited by viability of the offspring at one extreme
and by placental senescence and the ability of the fetus to
pass through the pelvic canal at the other.


**G. Predicting the Future**


The concept that phenotypic traits formed during development, and which confer fitness advantage in some way will,
if they have a heritable component, be selected during evolution is uncontentious. Similarly the concept that plasticity
itself is an evolved and conserved process is generally accepted. But a relatively new concept concerns the role of
developmental anticipation, i.e., that the developing organism can detect critical aspects of the current environment
and use these as cues for the induction of a developmental
path which can potentially confer adaptive benefit later. For
example, frog larvae exposed to chemical signals suggesting
the presence of a predator will develop into tadpoles with
tail morphology allowing greater swimming speed and thus
greater chance of survival (393). That this might confer a
later life disadvantage is traded-off against the adaptive
advantage of the changes to tadpole morphology because
they provide a greater chance of survival to reproduce.


Such anticipatory responses are common across all biological taxa and can span generations. Other well-known examples are the helmet in _Daphnia_, the shell morphology of
the whelk, and the thicker body of the crucian carp that
form in response to signals of predation (66, 141). Studies
in _Daphnia_ show the critical importance of the developmental stage in determining the phenotypic outcome (408).
The example given earlier of the desert locust indicates the
use of an early cue to predict later overcrowding and thus
the development of a morph able to migrate to a more
favorable environment. The examples differ in that in

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



_Daphnia_ the cue is passed directly from the environment to
the developing individual; in the locust, it is mediated by the
mother when she lays her eggs. For mammals, the role of the
mother both before birth and in infancy is even more important as a transducer of the current environment. Licking
and grooming behavior of the rat dam, which may convey
information about her stress level, has prolonged effects on
the stress responses of her pups (95). Belding’s ground
squirrels developing in open grassland habitats, where the
risk of predation is higher, develop into more anxious
adults than do those developing in woodland habitats
(386). Similar effects of parental stress levels on the offspring are seen in arctic species such as the lemming and
snowshoe hare (535, 536). A mammalian example that resembles the responses of the desert locust is reported in the
North American red squirrel, where greater population
density leads to an offspring phenotype characterized by
faster growth and earlier puberty. That the effect is induced
by population density detected by the mother is shown by
its occurrence when recorded calls of squirrels in dense
populations are played (120). The effect may be mediated
by maternal glucocorticoids (see sect. IV _C_ ) as their metabolite levels in feces are increased. Maternal effects may integrate a range of environmental aspects, as well as affecting
a range of phenotypic characteristics in the offspring (134).


We have termed the class of developmental response that
underpins these adaptive anticipatory traits predictive
adaptive responses (PARs) **(TABLE 1)** (210, 220). There is
growing support for the concept from a range of species,
(e.g., Ref. 513; see also Ref. 33). The prediction does not
need to be perfectly accurate for the capacity to respond in
anticipation to have evolved: provided the prediction is
more often correct than incorrect, the capacity to predict
will have adaptive potential (204, 282). Several studies have
modeled the adaptive advantage of a predictive response in
early development and shown that, despite the considerable
potential for error in the prediction, it confers advantage as
long as there is some inertia in the cue, i.e., that the environmental change is interpreted as persisting over a significant portion of the lifecourse (411, 572). Nettle et al. (424)
have recently subdivided PARs into external, based on environmental cues, and internal, based on an organism’s
functional phenotype. We argue that this is an artificial
distinction and that “internal PARs” are equivalent to immediately adaptive responses (IARs). The suggestion that
PARs are only effective when the environment is relatively
stable is countered by the model of del Giudice et al. (134),
which takes account of shorter and longer term environmental effects with varying levels of autocorrelation. However, detailed analysis of the stability of the epigenetic processes underlying PARs requires consideration of their costs
(256), following Nishimura’s (431) discussion of the optimal delay between an environmental cue and the induction
of a phenotype.



There is likely to be a directional bias in the maladaptive
effects of an inaccurate prediction. Prediction of condition
A but being exposed later to condition B need not have the
same consequences as the reverse, and thus there may be an
advantage in evolving mechanisms which favor one set of
predictions over another. As we will discuss below, a good
example is that there is a greater fitness disadvantage in
humans predicting a plentiful nutritional environment but
ending up in a famine than the reverse: the former leads to
an individual who is poorly adapted to restricted nutrition
and reproductive function, at least in the female, is likely to
be compromised. On the other hand, even though a woman
who is better adapted to a low nutrition environment may
become obese if she lives in a high nutrition environment,
her fertility will be compromised only at extreme levels of
such obesity (297).


We recognize that the use of the term _predictive_ may seem
teleological; however, as with the terms _forecasting_ or _an-_
_ticipatory_, it is not intended to imply a conscious decision
but it does capture the importance of the response, hence
why it may have evolved.


PARs differ from the thrifty phenotype model of Hales and
Barker (241) in several ways. First, the thrifty phenotype
concept rested on the immediate advantage to the developing individual of economizing on nutrient consumption by
reducing growth: this is more akin to an IAR. If there were
unintended detrimental health consequences later, this was
unfortunate. In contrast, PARs do not necessarily need to
have any IAR nature and, indeed, can be induced by stimuli
that do not of themselves necessitate a developmental response and that are not necessarily accompanied by a reduction in growth: PARs are induced to gain a fitness advantage in the postnatal period until the time of reproductive competence. Furthermore, some attributes of a PAR
can be the opposite of “thrifty,” for example, a greater
initial insulin sensitivity in early postnatal life (401) which
may promote adipose deposition, greater postnatal muscle
deposition especially in males, greater appetite, and accelerated body growth. In addition, a range of behavioral attributes may be affected, which confer advantage in the
predicted environment, including appetite (611) and physical activity. Just as larvae of the butterfly _Bicyclus anynana_
develop stronger thoracic muscles if poorly nourished, enabling them to fly to potentially better habitats (513), so
offspring of undernourished rat dams will be more sedentary when kept in standard cages (612) but will run greater
distances than offspring of well-nourished dams if given a
wheel in the cage (406). These induced responses are not
easily viewed as thrifty.


It is important to note that not all responses of a mammalian fetus which have phenotypic consequences are predictive in nature: where the developmental cue is evolutionarily novel or extreme, it may induce a disruptive response

(see above); where it is severe but not disruptive, it may
induce an immediate “coping” or adaptive response (IAR),
usually a reduction in growth which allows the fetus to
survive (221); and lastly, the effect on the fetus may be
neutral in terms of both fetal survival and longer term effects, depending on the circumstances. Intrauterine growth
retardation in response to maternal undernutrition or impaired placental function is a good example of an IAR because, unless the fetus slows its somatic growth, the high
energetic demands of the fetal heart and brain cannot be
met. The effects of reduced nutrition or an environmental
cue mediated by glucocorticoids to reduce nephron number
is however an example of a PAR. In humans and sheep,
complete complement of nephrons is established before
birth, and the relatively low metabolic requirements of the
kidney may not confer a great survival advantage from
reducing this number before birth. Postnatally, however,
the kidneys receive 25% of the cardiac output, so reduced
nephron number may be adaptive in a poor nutritional
environment. The longer term deleterious effects on cardiovascular function of reduced number are not manifest until
later (19). PARs can occur independently of IARs or both
may be induced, and this is why fetal size often correlates
with longer term phenotypic outcomes that are associated
with disease risk, even though the processes which set the
risk may differ from those which restricted growth and
growth may not be only the causal pathway to later risk.


The distinction between IARs and PARs may seem somewhat semantic but is important because some critics of the
PARs concept (643) have failed to appreciate the conceptual significance of the clinical observations which show
that long-term consequences for the fetus can occur in the
absence of IARs (i.e., in the absence of reduced birth
weight). If the long-term phenotypic changes associated
with later disease risk in the offspring were simply a byproduct of a maternal adaptive response, then an IAR
would be expected always to be demonstrable: this is not
the case for such effects occurring in the absence of an effect
on birth weight (185).


Two questions become important in considering the role of
adaptive plasticity in the pathways to altered disease risk in
humans: the first is when in the lifecourse the adaptive advantage is demonstrated, and the second concerns the
causes and consequences of faulty prediction. Both of these
have been subject to some confusion from some commentators.


Williams (651) recognized that the pressure generated by
natural selection declines with age; survival to reproductive
age and fecundity are particularly important in defining
human fitness (299). Indeed, the well-accepted evolutionary
concept of antagonistic pleiotropy (652) is based on the
selection for traits that have value early in life even if they
have postreproductive deleterious consequences. Thus, in



seeking the adaptive advantage of putative PARs, one
would expect to see any advantage manifest in childhood
and/or adolescence, not necessarily in adulthood. Indeed,
PARs only have to give survival advantage into the next stage
of the lifecourse after they are induced to have adaptive value;
for example, if they are induced early in fetal life, their potential impact may be on infant and child survival. This key point
was not emphasized in the earliest expositions of the PARs
hypothesis (204).


A range of studies in humans has shown that maternal body
composition affects a range of characteristics in the offspring, including body composition, neurocognitive behavior, kidney size, and reproductive function (223, 413, 551).
However, a striking example of a PAR in human comes
from a comparison of Jamaican children who develop marasmus or kwashiorkor in childhood famine. Kwashiorkor
is more metabolically wasteful, and such children have a
higher mortality (169a); they have a higher birthweight
than children who develop marasmus in the same community (170), suggesting that their prenatal conditions were
better, leaving them less well prepared to meet famine. The
more economical metabolic phenotype in the marasmic
children was not only associated with greater chance of
survival, but was manifest as insulin resistance and glucose
intolerance in adulthood (179).


Misleading predictions can occur either because the environment changes over the lifecourse or because cues are
inaccurate or misinterpreted. Considering the nutritional
environment as an example, maternal ill health, placental
dysfunction, or unbalanced maternal diets affecting nutrient transfer can all signal a poor nutritional environment,
when in fact the nutritional environment for the population
as a whole is adequate or even abundant. Conversely, infant
overfeeding with formula can signal a rich environment
when in reality it is more nutritionally constrained.


We have already introduced the concept of maternal constraint, and this has important implications for how nutritionally induced PARs operate in humans. In humans, maternal constraint mechanisms generally limit fetal growth to
match maternal (i.e., pelvic) size and their evolutionary significance has been discussed elsewhere (215). In polytocous
species, the operation of maternal constraint may be linked
to the limits imposed by multiple fetuses. One important
component may be the saturable nature of placental amino
acid transporters (100), another the clearance of insulinlike growth factors by the placenta (28, 104). But, in contrast to nutrients such as amino acids and fatty acids, there
is no limit to the capacity of glucose to cross the human
placenta to the fetus, where it drives insulin release and in
turn promotes both somatic, and particularly adipose, tissue growth. Hence, in untreated gestational diabetes mellitus, fetal overgrowth leading to potential obstructed labor
may occur. That humans did not evolve a limit on placental

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



glucose transfer suggests that maternal obesity and GDM
were uncommon in our evolutionary past (375). Type 1
diabetes and GDM can be associated with changes in placental glucose transporters, although this appears not to be
so in late gestation (289).


Thus we can see two distinct kinds of “mismatch” operating with respect to developmental conditioning, one based
on postnatal evolutionary novelty (evolutionary mismatch)
and one a consequence of the qualitatively different nutritional signals operating between fetal and postnatal life (developmental mismatch). The modern diet of high glycemic
index and energy-dense processed foods is qualitatively
very different from the range of diets that humans consumed until recently (478). The modern diet exceeds the
range that can be predicted in terms of developmental conditioning because of its evolutionary novelty, and thus a
mismatch is likely between the diet predicted in utero or in
infancy and that which the individual is likely to consume
later. Such evolutionary mismatch can also have consequences for the development of the next generation as for
maternal obesity and gestational diabetes. There is some
evidence for the operation of a PAR induced by abundant
nutrition in utero, which may make the individual less able
to cope with a poor environment later. There is anecdotal
evidence for lower survival rates in larger individuals in
concentration camps (29), and in Ethiopia higher birthweight was associated with greater risk of rickets (88).


**H. Transgenerational Effects**


The evolutionary significance of the adaptive pathways by
which environmental information is passed across generations via the phenotype has been discussed above. We and
others have emphasized nutrition as the most obvious example, and examined how epigenetic changes are amplified
or modified across generations in the face of a sustained
nutritional challenge (70, 358). But there are also a range of
other cues that can induce transgenerational effects.


One may be the parental influences on the developing offspring produced by behavior. Animal data for this come
from research showing that the licking and grooming behavior of rats produces effects on the behavior of their
offspring, an effect mediated via epigenetic changes in the
hippocampus of the pups (368) involving the GABA system
(677). As cross-fostering in infancy abolished the effect, this
can be considered an example of indirect epigenetic inheritance (218). In the wider context, the effect has similarities
with niche construction (445). In humans, a range of behavioral attributes are passed between generations and, while it
has been generally considered that these are culturally
transmitted, the animal observations also raise the possibility of epigenetic effects. Indeed, a recent and somewhat
controversial study has suggested that suicide victims who
had been abused as children have the same epigenetic



changes in their hippocampus as the low groomed rats
(394). Such epigenetic dysregulation has also been observed
in cord blood from neonates born to mothers who experienced depression late in pregnancy (443). At age 3 mo,
assessment of salivary cortisol levels following exposure to
a stressor showed that these infants had heightened HPA
stress responses. This is an area requiring careful research
across generations to resolve the extent to which human
behavior may be conditioned by prior generations or by
biological processes in utero or infancy.


Female-line transmission from F0 to F2 generations could be
produced by an effect on the primordial ovarian follicles
developing in the fetus, as they contain the maternal genetic
information which will pass to the grand-offspring at the
time of fertilization. There is growing evidence that such
effects can be mediated by epigenetic processes (672). When
such a process operates, a stimulus to the F0 generation may
produce effects on the F2 offspring phenotype but should
not affect F3 or subsequent generations unless the environmental cue is repeated during the development of these
generations. There are several examples of such transmission (70, 144). For the process to be termed truly transgenerational as opposed to intergenerational therefore, it
should be manifest in the F3 generation without the environmental cue persisting into the F1 generation (547).


There is growing interest in the intergenerational transmission of effects via the male line (236, 272, 670), although it
is unclear how prevalent such effects might be. However, it
is now clear that some DNA methylation and chromatin
marks can persist in the sperm (84) and that the small
amount of cytoplasm remaining in the sperm contains microRNAs that have been shown experimentally to have
phenotypic effects (488). For example, injection of RNA
from sperm of mice heterozygotic for the Kit paramutation
which results in a white spotted phenotype into wild-type
embryos led to their developing the spotted phenotype
(487). Injection of a miRNA associated with cardiac hypertrophy into embryos led to transmission of the effect to the
F3 generation (622). Additionally such transmission appears to involve DNA methylation (317). Dramatic male
line transmission effects have been shown for chemical exposures, in particular to endocrine disruptor chemicals such
as vinclozolin which have anti-estrogenic and pro-testosteronic properties. Administration of these chemicals to male
rats can produce effects on sperm counts and markers of
testicular cancer up to the fifth generation, mediated by the
male line (11). Manikkam et al. (380) recently showed that
endocrine disruptors such as BPA, DEHP, and DBP derived
from plastics can induce epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of conditions such as obesity and reproductive disorders and that these are accompanied by sperm epimutations. In mice, fear responses to a chemical stimulus, conditioned by an electric shock, are passed from male rats to
their offspring even when the dam was unexposed (136). In

rats, dexamethasone prenatally administered to males leads
to metabolic effects in offspring (144), and paternal obesity
induces pancreatic dysfunction in female offspring (426). In
the latter study, myriad gene expression changes were detected in offspring islets; the largest change was seen for a
gene encoding a component of the Jak-Stat signal transduction pathway and was coincident with hypomethylation at
its putative regulatory region. Paternal prediabetes in mice
leads to disrupted glucose metabolism in offspring that persists to at least the F2 generation, and induces an array of
methylome alterations in offspring pancreatic islets (639).
Most interestingly, many of these epigenomic changes were
reflected in paternal sperm. In humans, fathers of low-birthweight infants are more likely to have metabolic disease
(262), while a poorer lipid profile in childhood has been
linked to advanced paternal age (519). In an historial study
of a Swedish rural population, poor nutrition before puberty in men was associated with lower incidence of diabetes or cardiovascular disease in their grandsons (302).
Smoking in fathers in adolescence is associated with increased risk of obesity in their sons (463). Recent evidence
(382) shows that smoking can affect miRNAs in sperm,
raising the prospect that aspects of paternal behavior can
have epigenetic effects on the next generation. Other mechanisms of transgenerational transmission via the male line
may include changes in the packaging of DNA around
protamine, a cue in the semen, because offspring of male
mice lacking seminal vesicles are fatter (65), or even prions,
which can induce heritable traits in yeast (242).


**IV. PHYSIOLOGICAL (ADAPTIVE)**
**PATHWAYS IN DOHaD**


The discussion above distinguishes between ultimate and
proximate mechanisms that are encompassed within the
study of DOHaD-related phenomena. Lack of clarity over
the multiple underlying mechanisms and pathways has
slowed progress in this field.


**A. Mismatch**


The acceptance of the DOHaD concept was delayed to an
extent by the lack of physiological insights into underlying
mechanisms: this necessitated detailed animal investigations (360, 398, 479, 480, 495, 576) in which it is possible
to define and control the stimulus used to induce the response, and to measure that response in a range of tissues
and at various stages during development and throughout
the lifecourse. The animal models used included the rat,
mouse, guinea pig, sheep, pig, and non-human primate, and
in each the DOHaD concept has been confirmed. However,
while much of the early work focused on the physiological
mechanisms, it was both the development of conceptual
models based on evolutionary principles (221, 241) and the
recognition of the role of developmental plasticity (30, 32)



and the associated epigenetic processes (214) that gave the
field a solid mechanistic basis and led to the acceptance of
the concept of “mismatch” (469) **(FIGURE 2)** . We emphasize
that it is important to distinguish between mechanisms operating within the normal range of developmental exposure, which are likely to operate via adaptive mechanisms,
and those associated with evolutionary novelty that are
likely to be nonadaptive in origin.


Adaptive responses operate at multiple levels in the organism to produce an integrated phenotype (217). The levels
are summarized in **FIGURE 7** . If the stimulus occurs during
early development, the responses include effects on stem cell
lineages that will in turn affect the growth of individual
organs and tissues. They produce effects on mitochondria
(3, 543, 586, 674) which affect metabolic function. Subsequent interactions between metabolic demands of tissues,
the levels of growth hormones, and the interaction between
blood supply and organ function then affect the relative
growth of organs. Finally, they affect control systems such
as stress responses involving the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system (474), hypothalamic function, and
appetite (61, 480, 495, 501, 571). These effects can be
viewed as changes in the speed of maturation of organs and
systems in addition to changes in growth. The effectors
operate on multiple pathways, for example, atrial natriuretic peptide has been shown to play a role in vascular and
renal effects, possibly via alterations in placental perfusion
(290), hormone production (418), cytokines (117), endothelin-1 (139), and the RAS following changes in AT1R
expression (673). For many of these processes, changes in
placental function are responsible for mediating the effects
(418, 526). Because the physiological processes operating in
such responses interact, effects on one system can be compensated for by another. This makes measurement of the phenotype complex, especially where there are multiple processes
involved in regulating a function. It can also explain why some
apparently straightforward interventions do not achieve the
desired result, as noted earlier for energy balance considerations with respect to obesity (584).


Where the effects concern behavior, they may also have
consequences for relatives or other members of the population. Where there are commensal species, such as the gut
microbiota, these may be affected too, and this may then
have further reciprocal consequences for the individual (7).
The mechanisms thought to operate at these different levels
are discussed in detail below.


**B. Physiological Mechanisms: Effects**


These are summarized in **FIGURE 7** .


Initially most animal studies involved investigation of effects of unbalanced or poor maternal diet and body composition on cardiovascular and metabolic function in the

offspring (69, 481, 592). The most commonly used challenge was a low-protein diet fed to the mother during pregnancy (554). This produced low birth weight and later
growth (unless the animals were cross-fostered) and produced effects on offspring blood pressure (6, 48, 429, 453),
the heart (91, 162), and blood vessel structure and function
(50, 64, 593, 669). There are also studies using global dietary restriction (253, 430, 611, 656) and low-salt diet (36).
The effects on blood vessels differ between beds (595). They
can be viewed as changes in the maturation of control of
vascular tone which involve a shift in the balance between
NO and endothelial hyperpolarizing factor (56) and which
can be affected by a high-salt (55) or high-fat diet and which
interacts with oxidative stress (438).


Dietary manipulation of postnatal growth in the offspring
provided data that led to the mismatch hypothesis, since
accelerated growth is associated with shortened lifespan
(292, 454–456), accompanied by shorter telomere length
in the kidney, pancreas, and aorta (580, 581) and reduced
antioxidant protection (582). Unbalanced nutrition in
utero affects a range of organs and systems, including brain
metabolism and function (186, 612), appetite (38), the sympathetic nervous system (517), HPA axis (476), circadian
rhythms (78), kidney (59, 398), pancreas (267, 583), liver
(68, 441), skeletal muscle (108, 109), brown and white
adipose tissue (372), and bone (340). Vascular effects on the
offspring include endothelial dysfunction and effects on in


traventricular wall thickness in the heart. There is considerable information about the processes involved in cardiomyocyte development because of its relevance to heart failure in adults. The maturation of the fetal heart in late
gestation, triggered by glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone, changes the balance of the � and � isoforms of the
myosin heavy chain (MyHC), the former being faster acting
and therefore capable of greater force development (640);
maturing cardiomyocytes become binucleated and no
longer divide. Subsequent changes in afterload, as systemic arterial pressure increases at birth and with vascular disease in later life, produce hypertrophic thickening
of cardiomyocytes. In heart failure, reexpression of fetal
genes, mediated by epigenetic processes involving a cardiac-specific microRNA (605), can produce temporary
compensatory processes.


In humans it is becoming increasingly apparent that longterm effects on health are induced in early gestation, measurable for example in terms of fetal growth in the first
trimester and cardiovascular risk in childhood (286). Similar considerations apply to the preconception period (603).


Adaptive processes can be induced experimentally in the
preconception and peri-implantation period via manipulation of maternal diet or body composition (76, 101, 102,
112, 595). In both rodents and sheep, such short-duration
dietary manipulation preimplantation produces sustained

cardiometabolic effects on the adult offspring (631). These
effects can be induced in the embryo in vitro, subsequently
implanted into the uterus of a recipient dam which is fed a
balanced diet (632). The effects are manifest even if the
dietary challenge is induced during oocyte maturation
(634). The results in both large and small animals again
support the PARs model (102, 633). The metabolic effects
on the offspring are sex dependent (73) and influence postnatal growth (71). Similarly conditioning effects can be induced postnatally in rodents, for example, by changing litter size (620), and conditioning can be reversed by neonatal
intervention (613). Distinguishing between the effects of
unbalanced nutrition in early versus later pregnancy is not
easy in the rat or mouse; however, in the guinea pig such
effects have been shown (47) on both cardiovascular and
stress responses in a manner reminiscent of the trimesterdependent effects of famine on those exposed in utero to the
Dutch Hunger Winter (507).


As these developmental effects are part of an adaptive strategy **(FIGURE 8)** rather than the early inception of a pathological process, they reflect lifecourse biology theory and
generate an integrated and somewhat stereotypic phenotype (218). From a physiological point of view, this phenotype has reductions in the size of metabolically active organs
such as the kidney, giving the individual a reduced reserve
capacity to cope with the naturally occurring detrimental
processes of ageing and unhealthy lifestyle. The trade-off
includes faster postnatal growth in the face of abundant
nutrition and earlier puberty, (102, 213, 551). In line with



many evolved traits, such effects show sexual dimorphism,
for example, in relation to body composition and metabolic
control (475). This is consistent with the concept of PARs as
Darwinian fitness traits are often sexually dimorphic. Such
effects, especially in relation to the timing of menarche,
growth in height, and adiposity have been known in humans for many years (see seminal studies of Tanner and
colleagues, e.g., Ref. 579).


How long after birth conditioning effects can be induced in
humans is an open question, but it is clear that they can
persist through infancy. It has been argued that it is the
catch-up growth in infancy rather than the environment of
the fetus that induces metabolic conditioning (545), but this
ignores the fact that by definition catch-up growth follows
impaired fetal growth. The issue is rather whether reversal
of the changed later disease risk is possible by postnatal
manipulation of growth, a matter yet to be resolved although there is some evidence to support the concept (544).
Most data on postnatal growth relate to postnatal overnutrition (see sect. V _B_ ), which is likely to involve a nonadaptive pathway, or to behavior where the distinction between
biologically conditioned and behaviorally learned mechanisms is complex.


There are a number of maternal and demographic factors
that can influence the risk of the mismatch pathway being
induced. Godfrey and co-workers confirmed the relation
between maternal BMI and fat mass reported in the child
(649) in adult offspring aged 28–32 yr (499). Interestingly,

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



however, the effect was greatly magnified in primi- versus
multiparous pregnancies. Other studies have also shown
both greater obesity, impaired insulin sensitivity, and
higher blood pressure (16) in first-born children. This accords with the mismatch theory as the processes of maternal
constraint would be expected to be greater in first-born
children and therefore the potential for an inappropriate
PAR is larger. Similar considerations may apply to twins
and multiple conceptions (291) and to preterm infants
(265). They may also apply in a complex way to maternal
age (567). Evidence is now accumulating for a greater NCD
risk in offspring born post-term (43). It is possible that this
also represents the consequence of the fetus outgrowing its
placenta or that function declines in the post-term placenta
(617) as apoptosis is reported in such placentas (553).


In many high-income countries, maternal age at first pregnancy is increasing as couples have access to contraception
and wish to establish careers or have a range of experience
before starting a family. The relation between increasing
maternal age and adverse pregnancy outcomes has been
investigated (342). Older women are more likely to have
declining fertility and to seek ART (see sect. V _G_ ). There is
also some evidence that risk of diabetes in the offspring
increases with maternal age (567), but this has not been
examined extensively.


**C. Role of the Placenta**


Human placental function differs in some respects from
that of the more extensively studied animal species such as
the sheep or mouse, e.g., with respect to amino acid transport (63, 354) and the operation of novel exchange mechanisms (98, 99) or specific gene transcripts (104). The functional capacity of the placenta, affected by its size (24),
surface area for exchange (e.g., Ref. 539), and perfusion
(87) are major determinants of fetal nutrient provision, and
this varies across the normal range. From a gross anatomical point of view, the placenta is fully formed before the
peak in fetal growth and nutrient demand (508). A range of
factors affect placental development from early in gestation, the concept of the placental exposome (353). As for
fetal development, the role of oxidative and nitrosative
stress in early placental development, particularly after the
rise in intervillous space perfusion at about 12 wk gestation
in the human, may be critical to subsequent structure and
function (77). In late gestation, there is currently interest in
whether increasing placental perfusion may promote fetal
growth in growth-restricted fetuses; in animal models, the
administration of an NO donor promotes such growth
(137), and increased VEGF expression using an adenovirus
vector promotes fetal growth, although whether this is via
effects on uterine perfusion is not clear (83).


The placenta is sensitive to fetal demands, but its responses
are also conditioned by maternal factors. In the mouse, the



paternally imprinted insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) P0
transcript is responsible for upregulating placental nutrient
transport and thus fetal growth, a process limited by maternally driven IGF clearance (104). Placentas deficient in the
placental specific IGF2 P0 transcript produce effects on the
responses to nutritional challenges in pregnancy, for example, in being less able than wild-type placentas to upregulate
amino acid transport (532). Thus a mismatch between fetal
nutrient demand and placental supply, for example, in the
capacity of the small _Igf2P0_ placenta to supply nutrients at
a sufficient rate to meet the demands for nutrients for
growth by the normal fetus, can have long-term effects on
the offspring; this has recently been shown for increased
anxiety behavior responses (404).


Recent studies have shown that placental function is affected by caloric restriction (93), obesogenic diet (533), and
dexamethasone administration (609), all factors known to
produce a range of effects on the offspring.


Although the majority of work has been conducted on
amino acid transport, studies are now ongoing for the placental handling of fatty acids (356) and calcium transport in
relation to bone mineral accrual in the fetus (383) and its
later consequences for risks of osteoporosis and fracture
(105, 106), again with links to maternal nutrition.


Small increases in maternal and thus fetal glucose would be
expected to increase fetal growth if this situation represented the relaxation of maternal constraint, and mild hyperglycemia produces a small increase in lean body as well
as fat mass (132, 153, 574, 644). This may be viewed as
potentially adaptive, as in infancy relative adiposity provides metabolic reserves for thermogenesis, critical organ
function, and growth in the event of inadequate maternal
care (331). In addition, it appears that epigenetic control of
glucose transport (436) and adiponectin expression in the
placenta is related to maternal blood glucose across the
range from normal to pathological (60), indicating a role in
regulating placental transport and growth of the fetus in
relation to maternal nutrient status. Changes in the placental epigenome are now being studied systematically in relation to gestational age as well as maternal and environmental factors (437) and in twins (449).


The placenta plays a role in regulating the response of the
fetus to glucocorticoids and in integrating the nutritional
response with a hormonal response (418), initially as an
adaptive response ( **FIGURE 9** ; Ref. 418).


The balance of enzymes that convert glucocorticoids to the
active form cortisol (corticosterone in the rat), i.e.,
11�HSD1, or which inactivate it, 11�HSD2, controls the
fetal exposure to glucocorticoids of maternal origin (527).
There are parallels here with the role of these enzymes in
protecting the mineralocorticoid receptor of the kidney and

other tissues from activation by glucocorticoids (529). In
rodents, experimental inactivation of the 11�HSD2 enzyme
by carbonoxalone produces effects on the offspring including elevated blood pressure and hyperglycemia (367). Interestingly, glycorrhizin is a natural product in licorice with
similar properties, and studies in Finland, where licorice is
widely consumed, have shown that eating it in large
amounts in pregnancy produces effects on the timing of
labor and offspring HPA axis function (485). Poor maternal
nutrition in rats affects the concentrations of placental
11�HSD2, thus potentially exposing the fetus to higher
glucocorticoid levels (339).


Within the normal range, the adaptive responses of the
placenta will contribute to the PARs of the fetus. Outside
the normal range, pregnancy conditions such as preeclampsia or gestational diabetes have pronounced effects on placental function (135, 492). These in turn produce substantial effects on the factors that are likely to operate in the
nonadaptive range. The mechanisms involved include oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways (484). There are
now a range of studies reporting the epigenetic effects of
gestational diabetes on specific gene pathways including
those controlling growth and metabolism (511). Ongoing
studies are examining the extent to which maternal body
composition, including obesity, muscle mass, and diet, affects placental development and function (89, 355, 440).
There are some data showing altered methylation of a cardiovascular disease-associated gene, _ABCA1_, in placenta



and cord blood samples from women diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy (268).


**D. Conflicting Demands**


It has been argued that effects of environment on the motheroffspring dyad have more adaptive significance for the
mother than for her offspring (643) because, in the face of
conflict for resources such as nutrition, it makes more sense
teleologically for the mother to prevail; she has passed a
Darwinian fitness test in reproducing, whilst the fitness of
her offspring is untested, and her survival will allow her to
capitalize on her fitness by reproducing again. While this
argument may apply in rapidly reproducing species which
produce large numbers of offspring (382a), there is no evidence for it in the human. Indeed, considerations of life
history theory make it an unlikely strategy for a slow reproducing species where there is large maternal investment in
each pregnancy (207), all of which will be wasted if the
offspring does not survive.


Moreover, available data for human populations do not
support the suggestion from conflict theory that maternal
interests should be prioritized over those of her offspring at
times when resources are limited. Fecundity in humans is
only modestly reduced during famine (566), and under conditions of severe undernutrition, there is only a small reduction in fetal growth (506). Even lactation, which places

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



substantial nutritional demands on the mother, continues
during severe famine. Conversely, as discussed earlier, fetal
conditioning has long-term effects and occurs in the absence
of any obvious fetal compromise (185), and this similarly
counters the maternal advantage argument (226). Fitness is
not easy to measure in humans, as we have great control
over our reproduction and nurture even weaker members of
our species; despite this, a model which involves “détente”
between mother and offspring seems more appropriate, as it
puts into context both maternal needs and the opportunities
which an exchange of information between mother and
offspring offer for the subsequent fitness of the latter.


**E. Transduction of Cues**


There are two, not mutually exclusive, ways of looking at
the possible cues on which the developing embryo, fetus,
and neonate can base their predictions of the future. One is
to argue that the most effective cues, or reliable markers, are
those aspects of the environment on which survival and
fitness depend, i.e., oxygen tension, nutrition, water availability, and so on. There are many examples of how such
cues operate, from the fetal responses to hypoxia (234) or
hyperoxia (51), micronutrients (390), macronutrients
(225), and the responses of species such as amphibians to
thermal stress and dehydration (49).


The second way concerns the advantage of signaling indirectly aspects of the environment on which fitness depends, e.g., population density (392), predator numbers
(58), or other stress levels. Interest here is focused on the
use of endocrine signals that might provide adaptive
cues. Species that are seasonal breeders also utilize cues
related to day length (348) via transplacental melatonin
signaling. Anxiety levels or the need for vigilance in escaping predation are thought to be signaled via glucocorticoids produced by the maternal adrenal gland and
crossing the placenta or being present in the milk. In
rodents, stress induced in pregnancy or infancy leads to
altered behavior, stress responses, and cardiovascular
function in adult offspring (129, 277). In humans, there
are several studies showing an association between maternal anxiety or stress level in pregnancy and cognitive,
behavioral, or emotional problems in the child (249,
602). There are even possible effects on ageing mediated
by shortening of telomere length (163). There has been
recent discussion of the adaptive significance of such processes in humans (537), and del Giudice et al. (134) have
proposed the adaptive calibration model by which the
stress system coordinates and encodes, as well as regulates, the offspring’s response to a variety of physical and
psychosocial challenges and conditions, with implications for later adolescent behavior (161), for example.


At the level of tissue and organ growth, physiological
control is exerted through the action of growth factors,



particularly the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) (208).
Their actions can be modulated in turn by levels of IGF
binding proteins in the plasma (37), which also convey
them to the cell surface to interact with IGF receptors.
Fetal development is much less dependent on growth
hormone than on IGF. The mechanisms of action of all
these agents are complex, however, including effects not
only on mitosis but on blood flow, glucose uptake, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress.


Moving down the physiological chain of mechanistic effects, there is a large body of work concerning oxidative and
nitrosative stress. The balance between pro- and antioxidant species at any site depends on the level of oxygenation
(in turn dependent on blood flow and capillary PO2), tissue
metabolism, and the provision of antioxidant protective
mechanisms (122, 199). Because of its pivotal role in integrating stimulus and response at the cellular level, oxidative
stress is a fundamental regulator of development and has
been proposed as a process which “sculpts” development.
O2·� and nitric oxide (NO) interact to modulate peripheral
vascular responses to hypoxia in the fetus (414, 588), effects
which can be altered by antioxidant treatment (257, 305,
587) or statins (160, 594). In addition to hypoxia, underand overnutrition, infection, and exposure to exogenous
glucocorticoids all produce an increased level of oxidative
stress (122, 199, 461, 542, 589). There are a range of studies which show effects on tissues, especially the vasculature
(280, 502, 593, 624, 678), but there are also effects on the
heart (2, 258, 432, 627) and on brain development (590).
The mechanism by which oxidative stress operates at the
cellular level in these organs is now beginning to be elucidated. In the heart, the reduced expression of the cardioprotective gene protein kinase C (PKC)-epsilon in hypoxia
is prevented by inhibition of DNA methylation (460, 461)
or by _N_ -acetyl-cysteine. The process may be initiated by
norepinephrine via activation of Nox1-dependent reactive
oxygen species generation (665).


Circadian rhythms and metabolic control processes interact
in both physiological and pathophysiological states, as
shown by the perturbations in feeding and activity patterns
in rodents whose dams were fed unbalanced diets (66) and
the role of clock genes in diabetes (381). There may be links
with oxidative stress here, as the role of Rev-erb in adipogenesis is affected by heme, which in turn is modulated by
oxidative stress (322). The role of oxidative stress in conditions such as diabetes is not clear however; for example, it
has been hypothesized that the beneficial role of exercise is
to promote oxidative stress that stabilizes protein structure
(635).


Obesity is associated with inflammation; higher levels of
interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-�, and Creactive protein (CRP); and oxidative stress (128, 486), and
this can have adverse effects on the placenta (448) and

cardiovascular system of the offspring (627). The inflammatory process in a range of tissues, including adipose tissue, may involve infiltration and polarization of macrophages from M1 to M2 forms (373) which are associated
with a proinflammatory state and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (642).


As for the effects of hypoxia, the role of oxidative stress
associated with obesity is shown by the protective effects on
the offspring of maternal treatment with quercetin (362),
vitamin E (420), or a combination of antioxidants (531).


Oxidative stress is also linked to sirtuin-mediated ageing
processes such as telomere shortening, which can be conditioned by the developmental environment (292). SIRT-1 is a
histone deacetylase that senses cellular energy levels via the
NAD/NADH ratio (52), so it can mediate epigenetic effects
of nutrient provision and also metabolism. This pathway,
leading to changes in peroxisomal proliferator-� coactivator (PGC) 1�, is linked to fat deposition in the liver of
offspring of rat dams globally undernourished during pregnancy (653). Changes in PGC-1�, ER-�, ERR-�, and
HNF-4� can also be induced in rat offspring by feeding
their dams a methyl donor-deficient diet in pregnancy
(477). This condition resembles nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans and can also be produced in rodents by feeding a high-fat diet in pregnancy or postnatally
(68). A high-fat/high-sugar diet fed to dams produces epigenetic changes in the regulation of the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 gene, which is activated by sterol
regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), a transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of lipogenesis
(154). Further evidence for the role of epigenetic processes
in this pathway in humans is that methylation of specific
CpGs in the promoter region of PGC-1� in the peripheral
blood leukocytes of children aged 5–7 yr predicts their level
of adiposity at age 14 yr (97). These processes may remain
dynamic throughout life, as PGC-1� levels change rapidly
following exercise in skeletal muscle, possibly linked to mitochondrial biogenesis (17).


Other processes by which maternal obesity may induce effects on the offspring can result from the elevated levels of
insulin and glucose in the offspring’s blood. Insulin is associated with increased growth (261), and hyperglycemia can
have effects on the fetal heart (107).


There may also be elevations in RAS activity and in sympathetic activity (517). These interact with leptin to induce
changes in appetite. Prolonged sympathetic nervous system
activation can desensitize � receptors in the heart, for example, initiating a series of processes leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis (320). Again epigenetic repression of
PKC-�, induced by NO, may involve Nox1-dependent ROS
production (665).



Because the two types of cues referred to above are not
mutually exclusive, it is possible that they overlap. The
evolution of the glucocorticoid system may have arisen
through the advantage of a stereotypical response to an
environmental challenge, for example, from a noxious stimulus, predator attack, or overcrowding (422). In mammals,
the glucocorticoid system has a role in response to other
challenges such as unbalanced maternal nutrition (528),
hypoxia (200), or infection (231). Glucocorticoids are involved in the maturation of many fetal organ systems (175),
preparation for birth (363), and the control of fetal growth
(174). They can induce a very useful set of responses that
prepare the offspring for the predicted future and may be
induced from early gestation. Thus, in the sheep while mild
undernutrition in the periconceptional period and early gestation prolongs the duration of gestation (102), more severe
undernutrition shortens gestation (54).


For both of these types of cue, attention has largely been
focused on the parents in signaling aspects of their contemporary environment. However, another feature of the signaling may be of environmental history over a longer period, integrating this into a cue that drives the optimal adaptive strategy for the species (331). Indeed, some level of
inertia in the system seems inevitable so that the fetus responds to either sustained or repeated stimuli. This has not
been extensively investigated. However, in the studies of the
effects of intrauterine growth retardation on epigenetic
changes in pancreatic � cell Pdx1 (459), it was noted that
histone changes occurred first and were later consolidated
by more stable DNA methylation changes. It may be that
the more labile histone system responds first, and it is only
with persistent or repeated cues that a more stable change in
epigenetic state is induced.


**V. PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL (NONADAPTIVE)**
**PATHWAYS IN DOHaD**


These are summarized in **FIGURE 10** .


**A. Maternal Overnutrition, Obesity, and**
**Excessive Gestational Weight Gain**


A perspective derived from the principles of evolutionary
medicine (202) is useful in that it highlights the importance
of evolutionary novelty as a pathway to disease risk. The
underlying concept is that humans are unlikely to have
evolved protective mechanisms against novel challenges:
the modern western diet can be seen as one such challenge.


As for the adaptive processes discussed above, insights into
nonadaptive processes have largely come from animal studies and then been applied to humans. Most studies involved
overnutrition, especially the use of a high-fat, a cafeteria, or
a high-fructose diet (611). There have been some studies

using non-human primates, in which feeding a highly palatable diet to produce obesity in the mother induces placental effects and changes in fetal growth (166) and differential
expression of cardiac microRNAs (378), and feeding a
high-fat diet across generations produces aspects of the metabolic syndrome in the offspring (165). Other studies have
used sheep given the similarities to humans in degree of
maturity at birth. While sheep do not readily consume a
cafeteria diet, dietary-induced obesity in the ewe induces
detrimental effects on the cardiac function of their lambs
(271, 627).


The majority of studies have been performed in rodents.
A high-fat diet during pregnancy produces adiposity,
metabolic and vascular effects in adult offspring, changes
in aortic and cardiac lipid composition (159, 194, 315,
549, 586, 676), and also early signs of fatty liver disease
(159, 442), reminiscent of the NAFLD now thought to be
an early marker of metabolic syndrome. Changes in mitochondrial function are present (68). There is also evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy in this model and
for the disruption of the cyclin signaling pathway (14),
which may also include mitochondrial effects and epigenetic changes (145). Although many of these studies in


volved exposure of the dam to a high-fat diet only during
pregnancy/lactation, longer-term exposure which mimics
a human nutritional transition produces similar effects
(159, 516). Interestingly there is evidence that prenatal
undernutrition followed by dietary-induced obesity in
rodents advances the timing of puberty in their offspring
(550), a feature of transitional human societies, especially migrants (457).


Most recently, it has been demonstrated that, as for folate supplementation of the maternal low-protein diet,
methyl donor supplementation blocks the epigenetic effects of a maternal high-fat diet on offspring prefrontal
cortex, accompanied by effects on weight gain and food
preference (82). In the vasculature the effects of the quantity and the nature of maternal dietary fat on offspring
vascular function involve epigenetically mediated
changes in FADS1 leading to changes in prostanoid production (309). Ectopic fat accumulation is reported in
many sites in the metabolic syndrome, and such deposition even occurs in bone (340). Some effects on offspring
are mimicked by exposure of the pregnant dam to endocrine disruptors (79, 230), and there are effects on circadian rhythms as well as stress responses (see Ref. 78).

M. A. HANSON and P. D. GLUCKMAN



There is much evidence that maternal obesity and/or excessive weight gain in pregnancy is associated with offspring
adiposity. This seems likely to have a nonadaptive basis as
extreme maternal body size and nutrition is likely to have
been relatively rare in our prehistory (375). Once again it is
clear that the transmission of phenotype from mother to
offspring occurs across a wide range, both for maternal
weight gain in pregnancy and for maternal blood glucose.
At the extreme, fetal macrosomia is associated with a
greater risk of shoulder dystocia, obstructed labor and, in
the absence of modern medicine, stillbirth, genitourinary
fistula, and possible maternal death (62). Such problems
contribute substantially to maternal and fetal deaths globally. But such processes have not apparently been subject
completely to negative selection through evolution, suggesting they have been traded-off against the advantages of
bipedalism and large head size in our evolutionary past.
Although pregnancy produces relative maternal insulin resistance, which promotes glucose transfer to the fetus (335),
incidence of maternal obesity, high pregnancy weight gain,
and gestational diabetes would presumably have been low
in hominid evolution where high glycemic index foods were
not available. In support of this, and as discussed earlier, it
appears that there is no transport maximum for glucose in
the human placenta, as there is for many other nutrients
(126). Maternal obesity is likely to induce fetal hyperinsulinemia (86) leading to greater fetal adipogenesis (see below), although effects via other systems studied in animals
as discussed above have yet to be undertaken in humans.


There is now accumulating evidence from several cohort
studies that maternal obesity and excessive gestational
weight gain are associated with increased risk of asthma
and atopic disease in the offspring (248, 349, 469). Because
the effect is amplified by infant weight gain (371), it gives
another example of the consequences of mismatch (469), so
arguably they are not inherently nonadaptive. The role of
epigenetic processes in producing effects on immune function (384) provides clues to underlying mechanisms that
could be viewed as physiological, in shifting the balance of
innate versus acquired immune function. However, the exacerbating effects of unbalanced maternal diet, smoking, or
exposure to toxins or pollutants indicate their pathophysiological nature.


**B. Infant Overfeeding**


Infant overfeeding is essentially an evolutionary novelty
made possible by infant formula products. Children showing rapid growth in early infancy or in early childhood are
at greater risk of adulthood cardiovascular and metabolic
disease, especially if they were small at birth (164, 172). In
premature infants who are fed with infant formula, rapid
growth is associated with risk factors for cardiovascular
disease in adolescence (545). Rapid weight gain in infancy is
associated with childhood (447, 450, 569) and adolescent



(198) obesity and with childhood cardiovascular dysfunction (184). Formula feeding is widely believed to produce
rapid growth in early infancy (13), although the validity of
these data has been challenged (327). Meta-analysis shows
a reduced incidence of childhood or adulthood obesity in
breast- versus formula-fed infants (279). The protective effects of breast feeding may extend to allergy/atopy (444,
525) and cardiorespiratory function (212). However, the
protection against obesity afforded by breast feeding remains controversial (520) and may be explained by different effects of breast feeding in normal compared with overweight children (29). A further issue which merits consideration is the composition of the formula, especially its
protein content (556).


**C. Preeclampsia and Hypertension in**
**Pregnancy**


There is a limited amount of evidence that the offspring of
preeclamptic pregnancies have elevated blood pressure and
BMI (123) and also greater risk of later cardiovascular disease and stroke (124). Such offspring usually have lower
birthweight and are often preterm, although there appears
to be an effect of preeclampsia on offspring cardiovascular
and metabolic risk independent of gestational age. The relative contributions of reduced growth, undernutrition, hypoxia, as well as anti-angiogenic and immune factors to the
effects on the offspring are not known. In addition, there
may be effects related to maternal hypertension and preterm birth (345) (see below).


**D. Preterm Birth**


A range of studies have shown an association between preterm birth and higher risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin
resistance, and T2D in the offspring as children or adults
(265, 278, 351, 387, 471). The assumption has been that
this is largely due to the small size of the infant at birth as
shown from a large historical cohort (57). We have discussed above why this explanation does not seem adequate.
A recent study (626) has, however, separated out these components in a prospective cohort in which births were classified as early preterm (�34 wk), late preterm (34–36 wk),
early term (37–38 wk), and full term (�39 wk gestation).
Wang et al. (626) confirmed the association between
plasma insulin level in children and their size at birth (SGA
vs. AGA) but also found an independent association with
gestational age in their four categories. This persisted after
correcting for ethnicity, maternal smoking, BMI prepregnancy, parity, pre- and gestational diabetes, and also infant’s sex and birthweight for gestational age. Moreover,
the plasma insulin levels at birth tracked into those in the
children in early childhood (up to 6.5 yr old). The study
thus provides evidence for prenatal factors conditioning
postnatal insulin sensitivity, although as yet it is not known

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



how this is mediated, or whether it depends on the conditions leading to preterm delivery. It does however raise the
question of whether late (and possibly some early) preterm
birth should be viewed as part of an adaptive response; the
consequences of extremely preterm birth and very low
birthweight (269) are likely to be an IAR.


**E. Gestational Diabetes Mellitus**


Pregnancy is associated with some degree of insulin resistance due to the actions of placental lactogen (306) and
growth hormone (21). This is thought to induce a homeorhetic change in maternal physiology to favor glucose
transfer to the fetus. But as discussed above, there is no
effective barrier to placental glucose transfer and thus, if
maternal glucose rises excessively so will fetal glucose, leading to fetal hyperinsulinemia and excess somatic and particularly adipose growth. There are also distinct epigenetic
effects (157). The consequences if untreated can be dystocia
and fetal and maternal death; thus we have argued that
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is an evolutionary novelty and that the consequences for the next generation have
nonadaptive origin.


GDM is more common in obese women and in those with a
preexisting predisposition to insulin resistance. Women of
lower birth weight themselves have a greater risk of developing GDM, reflecting their already conditioned predisposition to insulin resistance (153), whilst genetic variants
associated with T2D are also associated with increased risk
of GDM (324, 341). The evolutionarily novel situation of
abundant nutrition and low levels of physical activity plays
an important role in perpetuating a vicious cycle of disease.
New criteria for defining GDM (402) have now produced a
dramatic upward revision in the number of women suffering from this condition, the prevalence of which is approaching 30% in some parts of the world (244), especially
in populations which have gone through rapid socioeconomic and nutritional transition such as parts of Asia (263),
the Middle East, and some Pacific islands (629). Indeed, in
a Canadian First Nation Peoples population, the proportion of T2D incidence explicable in terms of GDM in the
previous generation was 30% (148, 671).


Apart from GDM, the link between maternal diabetes and
risk of metabolic syndrome in the offspring is well established (see Ref. 648). Epidemiological studies show greater
risk of diabetes in children of type 1 or 2 diabetic mothers
(307, 347, 465, 555). This risk of diabetes is greater in
children born after the mother is diagnosed with diabetes,
presumably due to prenatal exposure to hyperglycemia
(116). These offspring are also more likely to develop diabetes at a younger age (466). Recent studies show that even
individuals exposed to mild hyperglycemia prenatally have
greater adiposity and risk of later diabetes and cardiometabolic disease (237, 578), and there is evidence from a meta


analysis that GDM is associated with higher blood pressure
in offspring (1).


**F. Caesarean Delivery**


There is a small but clear increased risk of diabetes in offspring born by caesarean section (81), which is of course an
evolutionary novelty. One possible mechanism concerns
the gut microbiota, which colonize the infant gut from the
maternal vaginal and gastrointestinal tracts and which
differs according to the mode of delivery (7). Interestingly, use of antibiotics in the first six months of life in a
large Danish cohort of mother-child dyads is associated
with childhood overweight in offspring of normal
weight, but not of obese, mothers perhaps as a result of
effects on the gut microbiota (7).


**G. Assisted Reproductive Technologies**


An issue that is now receiving much attention concerns the
apparently greater risk of NCDs in offspring conceived by
ART (250), also an evolutionary novelty. It is of note that
the effects seem to be independent of the medical or other
reasons for the couple seeking fertility treatment. Animal
studies show that short-term culture of the early embryo
can induce NCD risk-related phenotypes (632), and this
appears to be the case even for effects of maternal dietary
manipulation during the period of oocyte maturation (634).
In humans, the hormonal treatments used to induce ovulation prior to ART may have longer-term effects. Some of
these effects may be mediated by epigenetic processes (604).


**H. Effects of Drugs**


Relatively few drugs are prescribed in pregnancy, and the
teratogenic **(TABLE 1)** effects of thalidomide, prescribed to
control hyperemesis, are well-known (391). There has been
considerable research on the effects of antenatal steroids
given to women with threatened premature delivery, to accelerate fetal lung maturation. Exogenous glucocortioids
such as dexamethasone, given during a critical period of
early development, are detrimental to cardiovascular and
renal function and to glucose homeostasis in several species
(140, 388, 528) and affect neurocognitive function in juvenile non-human primates (503). Most obstetricians now
advocate use of only a single dose of glucocorticoid, although even this has been reported to be associated with
elevated blood pressure in some children (405). Young
adults exposed to a single course of betamethasone in utero
showed no psychological or health-related quality of life
effects (118), although there were small effects on glucose
tolerance (119). The most recent evidence comes from a
Cochrane review of 10 trials, which concluded that there is
benefit of multiple versus single doses for neonatal outcomes, without any evidence of either significant benefit or

M. A. HANSON and P. D. GLUCKMAN



harm at follow-up (396). At present, it appears that the gain
from administration of antenatal corticosteroids, preferably as a single dose, outweighs the potential disadvantage.


**I. Smoking, Toxins, and Endocrine Disruptor**
**Chemicals**


Smoking is well-known to produce a range of effects on the
fetus, including overall growth restriction (419) and effects
on the development of many organs and systems. There are
similar concerns about a range of toxins to which the
woman and her fetus or suckling infant may be exposed,
including those produced by bacteria (288) or fungi (e.g.,
Ref. 490) in foodstuffs. The detrimental effects of maternal
viral or bacterial infection are also well-known, and possible detrimental effects on the fetus associated with their
treatment raise other issues (15, 67) as are those of infestation with parasites such as _Plasmodium falciparum_, _Schis-_
_tosoma_, or tapeworm (435, 557, 610). There is great concern about alcohol consumption in pregnancy, and although the recommended safe limit is low, only high levels
of consumption are associated with fetal alcohol syndrome
and permanent effects on the offspring (300). Cocaine and
other drugs are well-known to have a range of effects on the
fetus (41), with consequences for cardiometabolic, neural,
and behavioral development in the child.


In many industrial and heavily populated urban areas, exposure to heavy metals, dyes, and airborne microparticles is
of concern (189, 561, 597). A well-known example of detrimental effects is the contamination of rice oil with PCBs in
Japan in 1968, leading to the hyperpigmentation of Yusho
disease and low birth weight (597). Similar concerns relate
to exposure to pesticides and other agrichemicals in some
rural settings (255). The concentrations of such compounds
build up in the mother’s body over time, and this may
explain the relation between effects on the offspring and
birth order (314).


The most dramatic effects of such agents are teratological or
increased risk of cancer, especially of the reproductive system, in the offspring (558). Such effects are clearly disruptive of development. Some of these agents produce effects
on endocrine (45) and nuclear receptor (346) function,
hence the term _endocrine disruptor chemicals_ (EDCs). In
some instances they may act via effects on epigenetic control
systems regulating endocrine function (548), and this is an
area of intense research and debate. By acting in this way,
they can induce greater risk of NCDs without producing an
overt disruption of development per se. In animals, prenatal
exposure to compounds such as bisphenol A can produce
effects on offspring adiposity and cardiometabolic control
(79, 615). As the effects of an EDC in isolation can be
subtle, and as even low environmental levels of several
EDCs can act together to affect development, more research
on their long-term health effects is needed. A recent report



from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on possible effects during pregnancy (491) seems to
demonstrate the importance of the precautionary principle
in this regard, but may cause unnecessary anxiety in an area
for which evidence is not clear.


**VI. BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF THE**
**DOHaD CONCEPT**


**A. Evolutionary Developmental Biology**


For natural selection to produce an evolutionary modification, an environmental change, if sustained, must lead to an
alteration in genotype that is both adaptive and heritable.
But the principles of developmental plasticity suggest that
initially these responses may be transient and induced by
epigenetic processes. The issue then is whether such induced
epigenetic changes could influence the likelihood of
genomic change (296) and how these phenotypic changes
get fixed into the genotype by the processes of genetic assimilation **(TABLE 1)** (647). Two models of genetic assimilation were proposed by Waddington: the first was simply
the uncovering of covert genetic variation and selection
against modifying genes which suppressed the exhibition of
the desired gene, and the second was that such “fixation”
occurs by random mutation. More recently, the possibility
of a bias in the pattern of mutation has been proposed based
on the greater mutability of methylated cytosine, which
may spontaneously convert to thymine (467). The evidence
for this possibility has been reviewed elsewhere (32, 33).


Much has been written on the evolution of adaptive developmental plasticity (32, 196, 282, 468, 647), but its implications have not been fully reconciled with classical evolutionary theory. The concepts described above suggest the
possibility that while adaptive developmental variants are
induced during transient environmental change, and preserved in fluctuating environments, they might become
fixed during sustained environmental change. This would
provide a new model by which epigenetically initiated but
biased mutation could lead to developmentally driven evolutionary change and reconcile evolutionary developmental
biology with classical evolutionary biology. Indeed, evidence for such transition is found in cancer cells (233),
which can be seen as a form of evolution occurring at a
cellular clone level. There are now a range of reports which
suggest the operation of such processes, although they are
beyond the scope of this review (80, 103, 218, 296, 301,
359, 505, 675, but see Refs. 276, 625).


These concepts have many attractive, albeit unproven, aspects. First they explain how an adaptive process can occur
rapidly enough to meet an environmental challenge. In addition, they allow such a process to be induced in several
individuals in a population simultaneously. They allow the
process to be “tuned” to relevant parts of the genome where



1056 Physiol Rev • VOL 94 • OCTOBER 2014 • www.prv.org

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE



the probability of mutation is greater at the site of epigenetic change. This is parsimonious and also protects against
the potentially harmful effects of merely random mutations.
Lastly, they allow the process of genetic assimilation to be
related to the environmental change itself. Because the epigenetic effect increases the likelihood of a mutation, such
assimilation would be more likely to occur if the environmental change is sustained over several generations. If that
change is transient, the reversibility of the epigenetic processes will permit the phenotype to return to a previous
state with no genetic modifications.


**B. Biomarkers of Risk**


The epidemiological studies that focused on lower birth
weight raised the issue of whether phenotypic characteristics could be used to predict individuals at particular risk of
later NCDs. However, the usefulness of any biomarker depends on its sensitivity and specificity. The association of
both low birth weight and high birth weight with greater
risk makes the use of this particular characteristic problematic as the adaptive and nonadapative pathways, which are
somewhat reflected in birth weight, involve different ultimate and proximate mechanisms that may confer different
risks of later disease. In addition, there are multiple pathways to a specific birth weight: a low-birth-weight fetus at
term may result from a slow growth trajectory throughout
gestation, a rapid trajectory followed by a period of greater
constraint, or simply reflect mild prematurity. It is likely
that the longer-term consequences of these developmental
trajectories may vary.


Even though measurement of the trajectory of fetal growth
throughout gestation is feasible, it is not routinely undertaken. Postnatal growth is, however, routinely measured.
This allows such growth to be used as a biomarker of later
risk, e.g., it has been suggested that crossing of two growth
centiles in the first 6 mo after birth is associated with obesity
in children aged 3 yr (585). The problem with the use of
such measures is that, as with birth weight, growth trajectory is more a measure of the integrated responses of the
infant to a complex set of environmental circumstances, an
end result of effects on metabolism, appetite, immune function, emotional, and other influences such as parental bonding, etc., so again infants with similar growth trajectories
can have different combinations of these processes in operation and so different later risk.


The broader question thus concerns the nature of any biomarker. Is it a component of a mechanistic pathway from
challenge to pathological state, or rather a measure of an
epiphenomenon that has occurred in parallel? Very often
the answer to this question is not known. Surrogate or
proxy biomarkers for a process are not necessarily inferior
if the effects on them are large and consistent, for example,
the use of cholesterol as a marker of cardiovascular disease
risk.



Developmental epigenetics may provide new opportunities
and certainly provide the capacity to estimate the relative
importance of developmental conditioning to disease risk.
Epigenetic marks measured at birth cannot only give a measure of the response which the embryo and fetus made to
developmental environment, but they can also provide measures of the setting of homeostatic systems, i.e., the conditioning, which will regulate responses to later challenges.
For example, the degree of methylation of one CpG associated with the RXRA gene is related both to aspects of maternal diet in early pregnancy and to child’s fat mass 6–9 yr
later (229). In this example, the effect size is large, with the
level of methylation accounting for 25% or more of the
variation in fat mass of the child, larger than any other early
life marker of lean or fat mass or current estimates of the
fixed genomic contribution to obesity. Confirmation of this
concept has come from the work of others using cord blood
samples (464, 494) and for the Southampton cohort with
child’s bone density as an outcome (252).


These studies used a combination of array discovery techniques to give a measure of the genomic regions in which
epigenetic changes may be manifest, followed by more indepth analysis of candidate regions. In addition, they examined whether the epigenetic changes occur at sites known to
possess SNPs relevant to disease. As this field progresses, the
interaction between fixed genetic variants and epigenetic
changes is likely to become more apparent (42).


Finally, biomarkers may or may not be useful as measures
of the efficacy of an intervention. This may depend on
whether they are reversible or not, usually thus on whether
they contribute to part of the causative process or are a
proxy for it.


**C. Possibilities for Interventions: Proof of**
**Principle in Animals, Opportunities for**
**Humans**


Several groups have explored the concept that an intervention given during development, either to the mother or her
offspring, can reduce or prevent the detrimental effects of
dietary mismatch on her offspring. Interventions that have
been tested are dietary, endocrine, or pharmacological. A
dietary intervention with folic acid or glycine, given to the
pregnant dam at the same time as the unbalanced diet,
prevented the effects on the epigenome in the offspring (82),
with similar effects on growth and metabolic responses of
the offspring (71) and on the transcriptome (366). The effects of folate can also be seen during the adolescent period
in the rat (72), which is interesting as its protective effects
are mediated after administration of the unbalanced diet of
the dam which induced the response. This effect has been
explored in more detail for the PEPCK gene (266).

Leptin administration to the newborn rat prevents the hyperphagia, adiposity, and other detrimental effects of mismatch produced by global undernourishment of the dam
followed by feeding the pups a high-fat diet (613). It also
reversed effects of maternal undernutrition on the expression of candidate genes and associated epigenetic processes
(222). There are more recent studies on the effects of neonatal leptin (515), exendin-4 (190), including epigenetic
effects (472), and growth hormone (232).


Oxidative stress has been shown to play a role in producing
effects of maternal low-protein diets on the peripheral vasculature of the offspring and the potential for antioxidants
to reverse this has been explored (502, 593). Because effects
can be passed to the F2 generation via effects on the uterine
vasculature of the pregnant dam offspring, this gives a further avenue for intervention, explored using an angiotensin
receptor antagonist to promote such vascular function
(514). Administration of a statin to the offspring can prevent effects on vascular function induced by the maternal
low-protein diet, and it restored endothelial function without affecting plasma cholesterol (594), an effect possibly
mediated by effects on endothelial progenitor cells. If the
statin is given in the second half of pregnancy, it can protect
the offspring against the conditioning effects of a maternal
high-fat diet (158).


While these experiments only serve as proof of principle,
they offer promise that, with the appropriate use of biomarkers of risk, timely interventions during development
may have the potential to reduce the effects of developmental environment in priming risk of later cardiovascular and
metabolic disease in the offspring.


**D. Developmental Conditioning and NCDs:**
**Policy and Preventative Interventions**


The developmental component of NCD risk does not conform to the generally accepted model of lifestyle and environmental contributions to the burden of NCDs. These are
primarily derived from the relatively effective approaches to
reducing the adverse health impacts of smoking, but the
interventions that have proven effective in reducing smoking do not easily apply even to changing the high energy
nutritional environments that contribute both to evolutionary and developmental mismatch.


Legislation cannot be focused so easily on particular aspects
of developmental or adult exposures despite considerable
attention to the latter in public health policy. Part of the
problem is the assumption that adult obesity and its complications are largely a function of inherited genetic susceptibility plus individual choice in lifestyle (203); at the extreme, this leads to blame culture, even the use of pejorative
terms such as “gluttony” and “sloth,” two of the biblical
deadly sins. Given the impossibility of returning to a pre


modern diet and lifestyle, a greater focus on creating resilience by obviating the effects of early life influences may be
critical.


The science of developmental conditioning thus offers a
different perspective. It suggests that a significant component of the risks of obesity and NCDs has a developmental
element that is potentially amenable to preventative intervention and monitoring through the use of epigenetic biomarkers. Thus the failure to recognize the lifecourse nature
of NCD risk and to incorporate it into public policy may
limit capacity to reduce the escalation in the NCD burden.
It is now timely to develop an adequate model of this risk
and identify points in the lifecourse at which it is most
sensitive to strategies to reduce it (660). The epigenetic epidemiological data reviewed above (229) suggest that the
developmental component is a major part of the pathway to
disease risk. The experimental and epidemiological data on
mismatch reviewed above make a point that is often missed,
namely, the nature of the response to the modern obesogenic environment is very much influenced by the early
environmental exposures even if there is little evidence in
early life of a phenotypic effect of that environmental exposure; it may be that the only evidence of the developmental
effect at this age lies in an altered epigenetic biomarker.


Public health policy inevitably favors devoting resources to
those with current illness over long-term prevention that
may not be manifest until the next generation, if only because the former are likely to be voters, taxpayers, and
influential citizens. Regrettably, when looked at from a
global perspective, the all-too-frequent philosophy of
“women and children last” when it comes to issues such as
food security appears to operate (530). As will be evident
from the science reviewed in this paper, this is not appropriate.


As yet it is hard to put a figure on the cost implications of
ignoring a developmental emphasis. For a hypothetical lowincome country, an estimate from the World Bank (8) focused only on low birth weight and a limited set of outcomes, in terms of health, education, and economic productivity. More detailed calculations have been made for the
early life consequences in terms of cognitive and noncognitive function (254), but this has not as yet been extended to
NCDs. The broad range of parental phenotypic characteristics that influence the offspring’s future, as well as their
lifecourse and even transgenerational influences, suggest
that a human capital analogy may be more insightful (121).


Attention is now being given to when in the lifecourse it
would be logical for public policy to promote intervention

EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONING OF LATER HEALTH AND DISEASE

these processes start to operate even before a couple know
that they have conceived. In addition, in many societies a
substantial proportion of pregnancies are unplanned, and
many women do not change their diet or their lifestyle when
they know that they are pregnant (113). Yet adolescents
have received less investment in health than younger children in many societies (521). The emphasis needs to extend
beyond smoking, alcohol, contraception, and violence to
health literacy itself. This is defined as the degree to which
individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make
appropriate health decisions (439) and operates at several
levels. Increasing health literacy to the highest level in adolescents would allow them to exercise self-efficacy and to
make decisions about lifestyle themselves. This may be a
particularly important component of addressing behavioral
responses conditioned by earlier experience (161).


**E. Human Development in the 21st Century:**
**Technology, Social, and Other Issues**


Human reproduction has changed dramatically over the
last 50 years. On the one hand, the access to effective contraception has enabled many women to choose when to
conceive. Many women now opt to have a family later in
their lives, to allow greater financial stability and career
development as well as freedom from commitments. As
fertility declines during the decade before the menopause,
this can lead to difficulty in conceiving for some women. In
addition, sperm counts are falling in many countries for a



variety of reasons including exposure to environmental
chemicals, lifestyle, and smoking (534). In parallel with
these changes, ART procedures have increased, not only in
usage but in complexity. In addition, techniques such as
sperm donation and surrogate pregnancy are now more
routine.


These benefits do not come without some health costs. As
noted above, first-born children may be at greater risk of
NCDs and the relative increase in the proportion of the
population who is first born has increased dramatically in
Western and some Asian countries. Children of older
women may be more likely to suffer diabetes in adult life.
And ART itself has been reported to be associated with
higher levels of cardiometabolic risk markers in the children, an effect which seems to be independent of the current
risk factors in the parents and their reasons for seeking
fertility treatment. The underlying mechanisms are not
known, but animal studies have shown that even embryo
transfer produces such effects on the offspring, as does dietary manipulation during oocyte maturation or even the
periconceptional period.


Once again, such observations reinforce the importance of an
emphasis on parental lifestyle even before conception. In all
societies the issues relate to empowerment and self-efficacy
particularly in girls and young women. The key issues were
raised in a report to World Health Organisation some years
ago (661) but have been little acted upon. They included the
following: access to secondary education, continued after mar

riage/childbirth; delaying first pregnancy until at least 4 yr
after menarche; diet before and during pregnancy and suckling; reduction of physical exercise levels in pregnancy; and
smoking cessation.


These issues are now being reexamined in the context of the
post-2015 global health agenda (90, 600).


**VII. CONCLUSION**


The field of DOHaD has grown rapidly to high prominence in
biomedical science, public health, and, to an extent, in public
understanding of science. However, many of the fundamental
concepts underlying it were articulated in different ways many
years ago, and there was much supportive data from early
studies that has now resurfaced. In hindsight, it now seems
surprising that the DOHaD concept took so long to join mainstream science. There are several reasons for this, related to a
slowness to recognize that DOHaD processes operate across
the normal range of development and are largely physiological
rather than pathophysiological. These processes can influence
the risk of later disease and involve multiple pathways. For
example, it is now recognized that risk is graded across the
range of levels of surrogate markers of development such as
size at birth and is not only associated with low birth weight.
Moving beyond association studies, insights into developmental epigenetic processes are revealing the mechanisms by which
the early life environment can influence phenotypic aspects of
the individual. This is indicating the normative nature of the
phenomena, revealing underlying mechanisms and providing
potential biomarkers of risk. Such markers could be measured
in early life and used to indicate the most effective interventions and to monitor their efficacy.


The field of DOHaD has been beset by the problem of the use
of metaphor, very often an issue in science when new ground is
being broken. We have discussed why the use of the term
_programming_ has been unhelpful; it implies that a mechanism
has been put in place that will inevitably lead to disease, and
that the process is ballistic because, once initiated, its outcome
is predetermined. This has raised expectations with respect to
associations between the environment in early life and later
incidence of disease that are unrealistic. We prefer the less
deterministic term _conditioning_ as it makes clearer the concept
that early life environment only conditions an individual to
respond physiologically to later environmental challenges in a
particular way. Other processes may intercede so that the response may ultimately be different. Moreover, it does not
carry the implication that disease processes start during development, as if they are pathophysiological from the outset.
Development can affect the future of an individual, but this is
always conditional.


We have discussed these issues in the context of evolutionary
biology in the sense that, as part of normal development, they
could be argued to have been selected during evolution as they



confer an adaptive advantage. We stress that such advantage
need only be manifest in terms of survival to the age of reproductive competence and until successful reproduction has been
achieved. Our concept of predictive adaptive responses encapsulates this, because environmental cues in development will
only be adaptive until reproduction is complete. The risk of
NCD, which usually increases rapidly in the post-reproductive
period, may or may not be influenced by the fidelity of the
prediction during development of the nature of the environment in the period up to reproduction. Throughout life, but
particularly in the post-reproductive period, disease risk increases due to the accumulative effects of inadequate responses
to challenges and to the consequences of changes in lifestyle,
behavior, and environment, etc. This latter group we have
termed “mismatch” to indicate that they represent challenges
with an element of evolutionary novelty, which neither the
individual’s development nor their evolutionary ancestry may
have equipped them to meet completely. The mismatch between an individual’s physiological phenotype and their current environment can occur at any point in the lifecourse.
During development this is linked to the category of nonadaptive effects which we discuss, many of which have arisen
through Westernization, climate change, socioeconomic progress, pollution, etc.


Evolutionary biology applied to medicine can therefore assist
in emphasizing the complex interaction between proximate
(e.g., an immediate challenge from unbalanced diet) and ultimate (e.g., evolved traits) in the etiology of disease. The recent
developments in developmental biology, and in the field of
evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo), contribute to
our understanding of this interaction. In particular, substantial
work in developmental epigenetics demonstrates how developmental plasticity may be influenced by normal environmental factors to establish phenotype. Moreover, the transgenerational passage of epigenetic marks, at least in animals, the
extent of epigenetic processes beyond imprinted genes and
beyond only the early embryonic period, and the possibility
that environmentally induced epigenetic change can affect the
probability of mutation are challenging long-held views about
the inherited risk of disease. The nature-nurture divide is now
widely recognized not just to be artificial but as meaningless,
and the genocentric view of life which underpinned neo-Darwinism is now severely challenged. The Central Dogma of the
Modern Synthesis, and the genetic determinism which followed, may have come to the end of their scientific usefulness.
In DOHaD, a new era of applied developmental physiology is
beginning.


We believe that the implications of such new perspectives will
be far-reaching. They will have direct relevance to the initiatives badly needed to address the challenge of NCDs globally,
by emphasizing the importance of including development at
the start of the lifecourse in interventions, and in moving beyond the emphasis on adult lifestyle and personal choice in
NCD prevention. This will have implications for the health

literacy and the empowerment of women of reproductive age
and their partners, of children, adolescents, and young adults.
It will require wider appreciation of developmental physiology, not only among health professionals but among policy
makers and opinion leaders. It will raise many issues concerning the distinction between human biology and our culture,
from ethical to philosophical to ideological. And it will underpin the success of interventions to improve health across the
lifecourse, operations which will have substantial financial implications across both low and high income societies.
