**Abstract**
BLUFORD, DONTRELL A.A., BETTYLOU SHERRY,
AND KELLEY S. SCANLON. Interventions to prevent or
treat obesity in preschool children: a review of evaluated
programs. _Obesity._ 2007;15:1356–1372.
_**Objective:**_ To identify effective programs to prevent or treat
overweight among 2- to �6-year-old children.
_**Research Methods and Procedures:**_ We searched six databases to identify evaluated intervention programs assessing
changes in weight status or body fat and systematically
summarized study attributes and outcomes.
_**Results:**_ Four of the seven studies (two intervention, two
prevention) documented significant reductions in weight
status or body fat. Among these, three sustained reductions
at 1 or 2 years after program initiation, three incorporated a
framework/theory, two actively and one passively involved
parents, three included multicomponent strategies, and all
four monitored behavioral changes. Of the three (prevention) studies that did not show reduction in weight or fat
status, all performed assessments between 4 and 9 months
after program initiation, and one used a multicomponent
strategy. Other significant changes reported were reductions
in television viewing, cholesterol, and parental restriction of
child feeding.
_**Discussion:**_ The paucity of studies limits our ability to
generalize findings. Among the available studies, multicomponent programs with 1- to 2-year follow-up in clinics or
child care settings were successful in their impact on
weight; they were likely enhanced by parental involvement.

Both treatment programs and two of five prevention programs reduced weight/fat status. Our review highlights the
need to evaluate more programs, advocate for use of a
framework/behavioral theory and objective behavioral measures, further examine the impact of involving parents and
the impact of intervention duration and follow-up time,
strengthen prevention programs, and further evaluate successful programs in other settings and among other racial/
ethnic groups.

**Introduction**
The primary focus of public health initiatives is to help
people become and remain healthy. Toward this end, there
have been significant efforts to reduce the prevalence of
obesity, which has increased substantially over the past 3
decades with a negative impact on health. National data
indicate that overweight (BMI for sex and age � 95th
percentile) among preschool-age children in the United
States has increased from 7.2% to 10.3% between the periods 1976 to 1980 and 1999 to 2002 (1,2). Among preschool-age children from low-income families in 30 states,
overweight (BMI � 95th percentile) increased from 10.8%
in 1989 to 13.7% in 2000, suggesting that it may be a
slightly greater problem among children from low-income
families (3). Moreover, studies have found strong links
between BMI values in childhood and those in adulthood
(4,5). Also, major causes of adult mortality, such as coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis, are associated with
overweight during childhood (6). Other health conditions
associated with overweight in childhood are higher blood
pressure (7–9) and serum insulin levels (10,11), adverse
lipid levels (12), and orthopedic (13,14) and psychosocial
disorders (15).
Many interventions have been directed toward adolescents. However, Hedley et al. (2) found no signs of the
prevalence of obesity being reduced among the general

population of adolescents. Furthermore, it is disturbing that
Sherry et al. (3) documented acceleration in the increase in
the prevalence of overweight among low-income children 2
to 5 years old between 1989 to 1994 and 1995 to 2000. This
suggests an urgent need to identify successful interventions
to prevent overweight among young children so that programs can be implemented before the prevalence of overweight among preschool-age children reaches the levels
found among adolescents.
Many approaches are being used to prevent and treat
overweight among preschool-age children; however, the
effectiveness of many intervention programs has not been
evaluated. To increase the efficiency of fund use and the
effectiveness of prevention efforts, it is imperative to identify and use successful programs. Although systematic reviews of interventions to prevent or treat overweight among
children exist (16,17), there is no systematic review of
interventions specific to preschool-age children. However,
Summerbell et al. (16) did include three of the studies we
identified (18–20) and excluded another (21) in their review
of prevention of obesity; Summerbell et al. (17) did not
include any studies that we identified in their review of
treatment of obesity. The goal of our study was to identify
and summarize effective evaluated interventions to prevent
or treat obesity among preschool children.


**Research Methods and Procedures**

_**Search Strategies**_
We systematically reviewed Medline, the Cumulative
Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO
(Psychological Abstracts), the Excerpta Medica Data Base,
Current Contents, and Chronic Disease Prevention File databases using database-specific keywords relevant to preschool, childhood, interventions, obesity, and obesity prevention. We also conducted a search of Medline, PsycINFO,
and Sociological Abstracts with terms related to weight
(obesity, BMI, weight change, skinfold, fat, gordo, overweight, weight-for-height percentile, adipose, avoirdupois,
corpulent, endomorphic), program (intervention, prevention, program, interference, intercession), and age (preschool, prekindergarten, toddler, bambino, and pediatric).
The search included publications from 1966 through March
2005.


_**Inclusion Criteria**_
Domestic and international studies of preschool-age children that used physical activity and nutritional strategies in
interventions to prevent or treat overweight, were at least 3
months in duration, and had a measured outcome variable of
weight status, BMI, or body fat were included. Case reports
or series were excluded. Studies were not excluded because
of their aim (for example, did not have to include weight
change), design, or duration of the intervention or follow-up



if �3 months, primarily because of the limited number of
studies found for review. Seven studies that met these
criteria were identified. Five studies reported new interventions developed by the researchers, and two (19,22) were
adapted from previously implemented interventions.


_**Intervention Frameworks or Behavioral Theory Bases**_
_**for Studies**_
It is well accepted that use of a grounded behavioral
change theory [e.g., social-psychological perspectives relevant to patient-provider interactions (23), social cognitive
theory (previously referred to as social learning theory)
(23), and behavioral economics theory (BET) [1] (24,25)] will
very likely enhance the impact of a health intervention
(23,26), and the use of a theoretical approach will provide a
framework for developing and carrying out an intervention.
Behavioral change theories are still being advanced and
developed to better understand the process of behavioral
change (27,28). For example, Baranowski (27) proposed
intervening on mediating variables that are the effective
manipulators of the behavioral changes of interest. To better
understand the theoretical basis of the interventions, we
reported the intervention framework or behavioral theory
used for each of the intervention programs reviewed.


_**Coding of Studies**_
Two co-authors independently extracted information on
the location, setting, sample size, intervention framework,
or behavioral theory used, intervention design and protocol,
and results for each study. This information was recorded in
a large table template with headings for each of the above
categories. These co-authors then compared their tables,
resolved discrepancies through discussion and verification
of the facts from the original publications of the studies, and
created a final table for these variables of interest. This final
table formed the basis of the results for this review.


_**Analysis/Summarization**_
We looked for both the magnitude of the effect of the
interventions on weight status and for patterns for these
effects in the context of the framework of the intervention,
the age of the participants, the setting, and the duration and
follow-up period of the intervention. We stratified the studies into those designed to prevent overweight and those
designed to treat overweight. Four of the prevention studies
were randomized control trials (RCTs), and one was an
assigned group program; both of the treatment studies were
pre-/post-test cohort studies. For the RCTs and the assigned
group program, we reported the differences in the changes
between the intervention and control groups, or, if not

available, we reported the changes observed in each group.
The control groups for the RCTs accounted for regression
toward the mean; the assigned group program had controls
although there was no randomization, so it is not clear how
much the controls accounted for regression toward the
mean. For the pre-/post-test cohort studies, we reported the
change in weight status between baseline and follow-up.
Regression toward the mean was not accounted for in either
the design or analyses of these pre-/post-test cohort studies.
Indices used to determine weight status varied by study.
If available, we reported weight status indices based on the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2000
growth charts (29) and statistically significant changes in
BMI _z_ -score (30).
Only key outcome measures pertinent to changes in
weight status were reported. Statistical tests with correspondent _p_ values or 95% confidence intervals were included
when available. A _p_ value � 0.05 was considered statistically significant.


**Results**

_**Overview**_
Table 1 summarizes the sample size, setting, location,
intervention design and protocol, definition of overweight,
and results of the seven identified intervention studies
grouped by either prevention or treatment in chronological
order of publication. Four studies were from the United
States, one was from the United States and Canada, and one
each was from Thailand and Singapore. Settings included
school, day care/Head Start, clinics, and home. Sample sizes
ranged from 17 to 1128, and children’s ages ranged from 9
to 70 months. As for intervention frameworks/behavioral
theories, four of the seven studies described using one or
more of the following as the basis of their study: Social
Learning Theory (21,31), self-determination (31), Adelarian
parent education model (19), BET (22), Transtheoretical
Stages of Change Model (31), Piaget Stage II (21), and
High/Scope Active Learning (21). Three studies did not
identify any framework or theory as the basis of their
intervention (18,20,32). Although change in weight status
was our key outcome of interest, researchers may have
assessed reductions in other outcomes such as energy intake, parental restriction of child feeding, television (TV)
viewing, or serum cholesterol, or increases in physical activity. Four of the seven studies found a significant reduction in weight or body fat status, two found no change, and
one demonstrated an increase in weight status among white
children, with no change in Latino children and black children.


_**Study-specific Findings**_
_Obesity Prevention Programs: RCTs._ Mo-suwan et al.
based their intervention design on their previous research (a


1358 OBESITY Vol. 15 No. 6 June 2007



retrospective chart review), which showed a relative risk of
2.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.88, 3.65) for obesity among
children with low rates of exercise (33); however, they did
not include an intervention framework or behavioral theory
as a basis for their intervention program. Mo-suwan et al.
(18) examined the effect of a school-based aerobic exercise
program on overweight indices. Their intervention and evaluation were conducted between June 1995 and February
1996, and five classes from two schools were randomized
into an intervention ( _n_ - 145) or control ( _n_ - 147) group
(Table 1). The exercise program was led by specifically
trained personnel and lasted 29.3 weeks in one school and
30 weeks in the second school. A log was kept of each
child’s participation. This intervention program was provided in addition to the curriculum of 1 h physical activity/
wk, which was standard at both schools. The control group
received only the routine 1 h physical activity/wk. One of
the schools had an optional swim class for 1 h/wk, and
analyses accounted for participation in this class in the
intervention and control groups. At baseline, both groups
were comparable in age, BMI, weight-for-height cubed (ratio of weight in kilograms/height in meters cubed), triceps
skinfold (TSF), parental BMI status, family history of obesity, and family income.
Mo-suwan et al. found among girls only that the odds of
having an increasing BMI slope was significantly less
among the intervention group compared with controls (Table 1). The authors’ explanation for the significant difference found only among girls was that girls are more docile
than boys, meaning that they may be able to achieve a
directed goal more quickly. These authors found a borderline significant reduction in the prevalence of a TSF � 95th
percentile at the end of the mean 29.6-week intervention
among the intervention group and no change among the
control group; however, at baseline, girls in the control
group had significantly greater mean TSF values than the
intervention girls (Table 1). The authors did not report the
effect of this baseline difference.
Harvey-Berino and Rourke (34) reported that they based
their pilot study on the Adelarian parent education model,
which focuses on the primacy of parental influence on child
behavior. They studied whether exposing mothers to parenting support skills applied to obesity prevention (encouraging discussion of eating and exercise) vs. exposing mothers only to parenting support skills applied generally would
reduce the prevalence of obesity in Native-American children. Their parental support program for both the control
and intervention groups was based on the work of Mullis
(34) and emphasized the child’s psychological and behavioral goals, logical and natural consequences, mutual respect, and encouragement techniques for use in parenting.
The parental support program for the intervention group had
a structure identical to that for the controls; however, it also
emphasized how to apply these parenting skills to the de

velopment of appropriate eating and exercise behaviors in
their children. A trained indigenous peer educator conducted this pilot program in the home of each mother/child
pair (Table 1). A convenience sample of mother/child pairs
was recruited through media advertisements, day care programs, and clinics for the Special Supplemental Nutrition
Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The pairs were
randomized to the intervention or control group. Behavior
changes for diet from baseline and completion of intervention were based on mothers’ keeping 3-day food records;
physical activity changes were based on data from accelerometers worn during the periods the 3-day food records
were kept. After 16 weeks, Harvey-Berino and Rourke
documented borderline significant differences between intervention and control groups in weight status and in energy
intake (Table 1). Also, maternal restriction of child feeding
was reduced more in the intervention group than in the
control group ( _p_ - 0.05).
Dennison et al. (20) based their intervention design on the
fact that one risk factor well-documented for overweight
among older children is TV viewing (35–38), yet the impact
of reducing TV viewing on weight status has not been
examined among young children. Using this rationale, plus
their concern about healthy eating and physical activity
patterns of preschool children, they developed a comprehensive 39-week program for young children called “Brocodile, the Crocodile” (20). However, they did not report use
of any framework or theory as the basis for their intervention. They reported on the change in TV viewing from fall
2000 to spring 2001 and the change in weight status from
fall 2000 through spring 2001 only among those who participated in the TV viewing sessions of the intervention
program. The change in TV viewing was based on parental
recalls of their child’s TV viewing/video games/surfing
internet in the previous week at both the beginning and at
the end of the monitoring period. The sample included
children in eight intervention and eight control preschool
and day care facilities (Table 1). At all intervention sites, the
same two interventionists, an early childhood teacher and a
music teacher, provided 1-hour weekly sessions promoting
healthy eating; seven of these sessions (the focus of this
analysis) were devoted (during the fall of 2000) to reducing
TV viewing, whereas the control group received monthly
instruction sessions on different health and safety topics. All
children were weighed and measured using standardized
protocol at baseline (fall 2000), winter 2000, and postintervention (spring 2001) (29,39,40). Questionnaires given
to parents in September 2000 and spring 2001 provided
baseline and follow-up information on their child’s time
spent watching TV/video games on average and during the
past week, eating behaviors during TV viewing, and
whether they had a TV in their bedroom. The two groups
were comparable for TV/video viewing time at baseline.
Parents were asked to keep a 1-week diary of their child’s


1366 OBESITY Vol. 15 No. 6 June 2007



TV viewing habits during December 2000 to increase their
awareness of their child’s media-viewing habits. Materials
were sent home with the children as an impetus to involve
the parents. One goal was for the children to not watch TV
for a week at home; parents were given a weekly calendar
with stickers to daily reward their children for not watching
TV.
Dennison et al. examined both proximal (behavior
change) and distal (anthropometric) outcomes. After controlling for sex, age, and pre-intervention media use, they
found that the intervention group reduced TV viewing,
whereas the control group increased TV viewing (Table 1).
Dennison et al. found a significant association between
children and parents in the frequency of snacking while
watching TV ( _p_ - 0.001) at baseline, suggesting a possible
influence of one on the other. No statistically significant
differences in BMI change were found between the intervention and control groups.
Fitzgibbon et al. developed a dietary and physical activity
intervention to reduce weight status using input from educators, pediatricians, nutritionists, exercise physiologists,
community health advocates, experts in minority health, and
focus groups (31). They reported that their intervention was
based on Social Learning Theory, Self-Determination, and
the Transtheoretical Stages of Change Model (41). Their
sample was composed of preschoolers from 12 Head Start
programs; the 12 sites were paired on the basis of size and
then randomly assigned to an intervention or control group
(Table 1). Children in the six intervention schools participated in a healthy eating and exercise intervention, whereas
children in the control schools were given a general health
concepts education. At baseline and at the follow-up visits,
trained data collectors interviewed parents as to the frequency and intensity of their child’s physical activity and
the hours per day that their child watched TV. Additionally,
at baseline and follow-up visits, single 24-hour dietary
recalls were obtained from parents for their child by a
dietitian; 48% and 100% of the 1- and 2-year follow-ups,
respectively, were obtained by phone. Although there were
no differences at the end of the 14-week program, at the 1and 2-year follow-up assessments, BMI _z_ -scores of the
intervention group showed a statistically significantly
greater reduction (Year 1) or less gain (Year 2) than those of
the control group (Table 1). Additionally, although the
intervention and control groups had similar percentages of
calories from saturated fat at baseline, at 1-year follow-up,
the intervention group had a significantly lower percentage
of calories from saturated fat than the control group. The
intervention group was significantly younger, exercised
less, and included more black children than the control
group. Age and baseline BMI were adjusted for, but
whether or how these other differences affected their findings is not reported.

_Obesity Prevention Programs: Assigned Intervention and_
_Control Trials._ Williams et al. examined how a change in
the school food service aimed at reducing saturated fat
intake, without compromising energy intake or nutrient
content of the available diet, modified serum cholesterol and
weight status (21). They based their intervention on the
Piaget Stage 2 Model, Social Learning Theory, and High/
Scope Active Learning (21). The study included nine Head
Start programs. There were initially three groups of study: a
control group with a safety education curriculum but without food service modification, an intervention group with
food service modification plus a child/family nutrition education program, and an intervention group with food service modification plus a safety curriculum (Table 1). Behavioral changes regarding participation either in the school
meals program or in the take-home activities that were
included in this program were not measured. At the end of
the intervention, data from the two intervention groups
indicated that the nutrition education and safety curricula
accounted for little change in the six modified food service
groups, so these sites were aggregated into one intervention
group for analyses.
Among white children, there was a statistically significant difference in the change in weight-to-height ratio between the intervention and control groups; no differences in
changes were noted for black or Latino children (Table 1).
Researchers also documented a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups with
respect to mean change in total serum cholesterol and the
prevalence of total cholesterol � 170 mg/dL; however, no
baseline comparisons were available (Table 1). Of note in
this study, the two intervention categories (three programs
each) had a longer follow-up than the control programs (5.8,
6.6, and 4.8 months, respectively), and the intervention
programs had more black, white, slightly younger, and
smaller children than the control programs. These potential
confounders were adjusted for in their generalized linear
modeling.
_Obesity Treatment Programs: Pre-/Post-test Cohort_
_Studies._ Epstein et al. sought to determine whether their
family-based program, grounded essentially on Epstein et
al.’s BET (24,25), which was effective for pre-adolescents,
could be adapted to effectively control overweight in
younger children (22). Their program focuses on weight
loss by reducing calorie intake while providing adequate
nutrition to support growth and by increasing physical activity through walking. The nutrition portion of the study
was an adapted version of Epstein’s traffic light diet (42). In
addition, there was a pre-intervention training of mothers to
use food models and verbal feedback to keep complete food
records for their children. The food records were used to
establish calorie limits, and foods from the basic four food
groups were recommended as nutritious choices. Behavior
changes in eating were discussed during the counseling



sessions and were assessed by parents using star charts to
note avoidance of the red (stop) foods in the traffic light
diet. Children whose weight status became �10% overweight based on their ideal weight norms specific to their
age, sex, and height (43) were given a weight maintenance
dietary program.
The physical activity portion of the intervention included
the parent and child initially walking 0.25 miles 6 d/wk; this
was increased by 0.25 miles every 2 weeks until a maximum
of 1 mile/d was reached. In addition, parents with children
younger than 3 years were given the option of one walk or
several smaller walks throughout the day to complete the
required walking. Behavior management techniques included contracting, modeling, and social reinforcement with
immediate parental feedback to their children such as the
positive reinforcement with star charts. These star charts
rewarded the child for walking the distance required in the
exercise component of the program daily.
Epstein et al. (22) found that the mean percentage overweight in excess of ideal body weight-for-height for age and
sex decreased significantly from baseline to 6, 12, and 24
months after baseline measurements (Table 1). Their results
also documented a substantial and statistically significant
reduction in energy intake after 10 weeks of treatment
(Table 1). There was no reduction in height-for-age percentile during the 2-year follow-up, suggesting no compromise
in growth.
Ray et al. (32), in their intervention program, used professionally administered goals and assessment (similar to a
management/consulting approach) for obese children in
conjunction with their families to prevent and control obesity in preschool children; however, they did not base their
intervention on any framework or theory. Their 1-year program was developed for the primary health care setting in
response to the increasing prevalence of obesity among
children in Singapore. The Ministry of Health, Food, and
Nutrition Department in Singapore trained 30 nursing staff
and doctors. They obtained their sample from children attending 17 Singapore primary health care clinics. These
children were from low- to medium-income families and
had a weight-for-height value greater than two standard
deviations above the normal weight-for-height (44–46)
(Table 1). Children with a physician-diagnosed medical
secondary cause of obesity were excluded.
For this intervention, a specially trained staff nurse counseled the mildly or moderately obese children. The severely
overweight children were referred to a dietitian for counseling until they reduced their weight sufficiently to be
classified as moderately overweight, after which they and
their families were included in the counseling program. The
counseling program focused on education and behavioral
changes with respect to diet and exercise patterns of the
child and family. During each counseling session, the nurse
discussed information on diet, exercise, height and weight

patterns, energy balance, and nutritional guidelines with the
family and child. Behavior changes were based on parental
reports of food intake and exercise patterns and were used
only for the counseling sessions. Initial counseling took
place within 1 month of diagnosis; follow-up sessions were
held after 1, 4, and 7 months. At the end of the 1-year
follow-up, Ray et al. (32) found statistically significant
reductions in all categories of obesity, and 20.2% of their
initially obese participants became non-obese ( _p_ - 0.05)
(Table 1).


**Discussion**

_**Overview**_
Our search yielded only seven interventions to prevent or
treat overweight or to enhance the nutritional status of 9- to
70-month-old children that measured weight status to evaluate impact. Of these seven studies, two of the five prevention studies (18,31) and both treatment studies (22,32) reported a statistically significant reduction in weight status or
body fat, and one other prevention study (19) reported a
reduction that approached significance.
The heterogeneity of frameworks/theories, strategies, and
outcome measures used made it difficult to identify any
single strategy of intervention that was more effective than
others. Among the four studies (18,22,31,32) that documented a significant reduction in weight status or body fat,
two (one prevention, one treatment) based their interventions on frameworks or theories (22,31), three (one prevention, two treatment) used some form of nutrition education
or diet component (22,31,32), all four (two prevention, two
treatment) included either guidance for or directed physical
activity programs, and one (prevention) gave remuneration
(31). However, the three prevention studies that did not
report significant reductions in weight or fat status used
similar approaches; two used frameworks or theories, all
had a diet component (19–21), and one included directed
physical activity (20). Of potential relevance, though, two
of these latter studies that did not impact weight had other
specific aims, to reduce TV viewing time (20) or lower
cholesterol (21).
The literature cites similar challenges in identifying effective interventions to prevent or treat overweight among
school-age children. Although there are more studies available for school-age children and adolescents, reviews of that
literature revealed heterogeneity with respect to study design and the theoretical models used, thereby making comparisons difficult (16,47,48). In our review of preschool
interventions, of the five that were multicomponent (physical activity and diet), three resulted in reductions in BMI.
The American Dietetic Association found that 32 of the 34
multicomponent (components varied) interventions among
school-age children were effective in reducing adiposity
(47). Interestingly, Summerbell et al. (16) found that inter

1368 OBESITY Vol. 15 No. 6 June 2007



ventions that included both nutrition and physical activity
components may have changed behaviors related to those
but did not significantly improve BMI, whereas interventions that focused on only one of these strategies did show
a positive impact on BMI. Additionally, the Task Force on
Community Preventive Services (48) found an insufficient
number of studies of adequate quality in design to support
recommending school-based interventions to prevent and
control overweight among school-age children.


_**Use of Intervention Framework/Behavioral Theory as**_
_**Basis for Interventions**_
The interventions reviewed used a variety of frameworks/
theories and strategies to prevent or treat overweight. The
only theory used by more than one study was the Social
Learning Theory (21,31). Interestingly, in this review, four
of the seven studies based their intervention on a framework
or theory, and only two of these four studies documented
reductions in weight status. The other two studies based on
theories found either a close-to-significant reduction in
weight status (19) or reduced cholesterol levels (21). Of the
studies that did not base their interventions on a framework
or theory, two may have achieved weight loss because they
either used a classroom program of physical activity with
good compliance (18), or the treatment program had individual child/parent counseling sessions that monitored behavioral changes in diet and exercise (32). The other study
(20) focused on reducing TV viewing at home through
daycare-based programs that included developing alternative activities to TV viewing at home; however, the use of
these specific alternatives was not reported, so we do not
know whether they would have the potential to reduce
weight status. Additionally, of the four studies that based
their intervention on a framework or theory, one involved
changing only parental behaviors (19), and the other three
focused on both the child and the parent (21,22,31). However, there was no mention as to whether the cognitive
models used were applied in a manner that was developmentally appropriate for the children’s age (27). Baranowski (27) points out that this is necessary to capture the
true variance of the behavior of interest. As previously
mentioned, there is evidence that basing interventions on a
framework or theory is likely to enhance program outcome
(23), so we would advocate for the use of these to develop
interventions.


_**Strategies Used**_
Of the seven interventions reviewed, five used both nutritional/diet- and physical activity-focused strategies.
Among the four studies that achieved significant weight loss
among the participants, three used some form of nutrition
education or diet component (22,31,32) (one treatment, two
prevention), all four (18,22,31,32) (two prevention, two
treatment) included either guidance for or a directed phys

ical activity program, and one (prevention) gave remuneration (31). Moreover, the three prevention interventions that
did not report significant reductions in weight status used
similar approaches; all had a diet component (19–21), but
only one included directed physical activity (20), and one
provided remuneration (19).
Behavioral outcomes of these interventions were based
primarily on parental reports; four studies used objective
measures, but three studies either did not monitor behavior
changes or used techniques that were more subjective,
which could have biased parental reporting. Three prevention studies and one treatment study tried to make these
measures objective. Mo-suwan et al. (18) logged participation in the physical activity program, Harvey-Berino and
Rourke (19) used 3-day food records to measure diet change
and accelerometers to assess physical activity changes between baseline and the end of the program, and Fitzgibbon
et al. (31) used 24-hour parental dietary recalls to assess
changes in diet. Dennison et al. (20) used parental recall of
their child’s TV viewing time for the past week and stickers
on calendars to monitor children not watching TV for a
whole day during their “TV Turn Off” week; however, they
did not report monitoring of diet or physical activity
changes associated with this intervention. Additionally, in
this study, it was difficult to delineate the effect of the
reduction in TV viewing sessions of their intervention from
the other sessions that emphasized healthy eating. Williams
et al. (21) did not report monitoring of any behavior
changes, including participation in the school meal program
that was the basis of their intervention. Epstein et al. (22), in
their treatment study, used parental recordings on star charts
of their child’s avoidance of “stop” foods and meeting goals
for physical activity; the other treatment study (32) did not
give details of techniques used to monitor behavior changes
but reported that they used these for goal setting for the
subsequent visit. Both of the treatment studies actively
incorporated monitoring of behavior changes and used these
to guide the subsequent setting of goals, which may have
enabled these studies to be successful in demonstrating
weight loss of the overweight children.
Clearly, the age range of the children at baseline, 9 to 70
months, included in these studies indicates a range in child
development abilities (49). Both the nutrition/healthy eating
and the physical activity components of these interventions
needed to be tailored to age-specific abilities. None of the
studies addressed this issue directly, but, in regard to physical activity, among the prevention studies, Mo-suwan et al.
(18), Dennison et al. (20), and Fitzgibbon et al. (31) appeared to have activities in line with the American Academy
of Pediatric milestones (49). Harvey-Berino and Rourke
(19) included developmental stages in lesson topics for both
their intervention and control groups, and Williams et al.
(21) did not include a physical activity component. As for
the treatment studies, Epstein et al. (22) appeared to have



reasonable physical activity goals for their participants as
they adjusted walking distance and time for age, but Ray et
al. (30) did not describe the physical activities that were
promoted. The healthy eating/nutrition components of these
interventions were not described adequately to determine
their appropriateness for the children’s age.


_**Role of Parents in Interventions**_
Researchers used either the child exclusively or a family
or parent focus as the entre´e to implement the different
strategies. Among the four interventions that reported a
reduction in weight or body fat status, the two treatment
studies (22,32) actively involved the parents in education
and activities, which included goal setting and follow-up;
for the two prevention studies, one passively involved parents by sending materials home weekly (31), and the other
involved only the children (18). As for the three prevention
studies that did not demonstrate a weight change, one used
parents as the agents of change (19), two sent home to
parents educational materials that included parent activities
(20,21), and one included educational group meetings for
parents three or four times during the school year (21).
Our finding that two of the four programs that successfully reduced weight or fat status actively included the
parents and another sent materials home to parents on a
weekly basis suggests that more work is needed to examine
how active parental involvement needs to be in intervention
programs for young children. Epstein et al. (50) showed that
when parents were included in the counseling plan, there
was a better reduction in weight status after 10 years of
follow-up than in the child-targeted group. Golan et al. (51)
also found that, in a clinical study of parent-only or childonly interventions for treatment of obesity in children, both
the parents and the children reduced their weight status; this
program awarded parents’ behavioral changes that could
help them promote, as role models, healthier eating, and
increased physical activity among their children. Dietz and
Robinson (52) also advocated parental involvement. They
recommended that parents be the ones to institute their four
proposed strategies for controlling weight status, which
include controlling the environment, monitoring behavior,
setting goals, and rewarding successful changes in behavior
(52). This approach supports change that could lead to
increasing competence among family members to develop
and reach goals and to monitor their own efforts toward
functional independence to promote healthy weight loss and
maintenance.


_**Other Documented Changes in Health Status**_
The three prevention studies that did not demonstrate a
reduction in weight or body fat status did document significant changes likely to improve health status. The Dennison
et al. study (20) showed a significant reduction in hours per
week that the children watched TV. Gortmaker et al. (37)


OBESITY Vol. 15 No. 6 June 2007 1369


Obesity in Preschool Children, Bluford, Sherry, and Scanlon


documented a strong dose-response association between
hours of TV watched per day and overweight status among
adolescents, and Dennison et al. (38) and Ma et al. (53)
documented the same association for preschool children. In
addition, reducing sedentary behavior (including TV viewing) has been shown to decrease energy intake (54) and
increase fruit and vegetable intake (55). In their intervention, Williams et al. (21) documented a reduction in serum
cholesterol levels, which at high levels are associated with
cardiovascular disease in children (56). Additionally, Harvey-Berino and Rourke (19) found a reduction in maternal
restriction of child feeding, which may be associated with
overweight in children (57).


_**Duration and Follow-up Period**_
In the seven studies, follow-up periods varied from 16
weeks to 2 years. By definition, we would expect proximal
measures to change more quickly than distal measures. We
consider behavior changes such as reducing TV viewing to
be proximal measures, whereas we categorize anthropometric measures as distal measures. The four studies that demonstrated changes in weight or body fat status had follow-up
periods of 7.5 months to 2 years. Impressively, in their
in-home program, Harvey-Berino and Rourke (19) found a
close-to-significant reduction in weight-for-height _z_ -score
after only 16 weeks of intervention among 9- to 36-monthold children. In contrast, Dennison et al. (20) found no
significant change in weight status at the 1-year follow-up.
Future interventions need to examine the impact of both
intervention duration and follow-up time on weight loss and
maintenance.


_**Intervention Settings**_
Our review demonstrated success in a variety of locations. In-home, day care, Head Start, preschool, and clinic
settings all were shown to be options for implementing
effective interventions. However, because each intervention
was implemented in one type of setting and may have
included only one racial or ethnic group, future studies need
to examine the effectiveness of these programs implemented in different intervention settings for different income and racial/ethnic groups. Income data were not available in some of the studies we reviewed, so we were unable
to examine this issue.


_**Strengths and Challenges**_
The seven intervention studies reviewed have several
strengths. Four of the seven were randomized controlled
trials, and four had sample sizes �200. In addition, a variety
of racial/ethnic groups were studied, including white, black,
Latino, and Native-American children. In the United States,
2- to 5-year-old white and black children have a similar
elevated prevalence of overweight—8.6% and 8.9%, respectively; however, an estimated 13.1% of Mexican-Amer

1370 OBESITY Vol. 15 No. 6 June 2007



ican preschoolers are overweight (2). Hispanic and NativeAmerican children are of particular concern; data from
low-income children in the United States suggest an even
higher prevalence of overweight among Hispanics (19.4%)
and Native Americans (18.0%) compared with whites
(12.3%) and blacks (12.0%) (58). Other strengths include
the use of a variety of social means to include the family,
such as increasing parenting skills and educating the parent
and the child.
The interventions reviewed also present us with some
challenges, which weaken the clarity of recommendations
from this review. The heterogeneous nature of the settings,
methodologies, intervention strategies, definitions of obesity, and outcome measures makes comparisons among
these studies difficult. The lack of use of a framework or
theory as the basis of the interventions in three studies was
noted. Parental reporting of behavioral changes during these
studies could have biased the study results; however, four
studies used more objective measures such as diet records or
accelerometers to assess changes. Some of the studies did
not monitor behavior changes or lack thereof; reporting of
these might have helped clarify why studies did or did not
demonstrate a reduction in weight status. Finally, none of
these evaluated interventions included a cost-effectiveness
component. As with the reviews of interventions to prevent
overweight among school-age children mentioned above
(16,47), our review also found a lack of evidence as to what
was the most effective component, duration, and intensity of
the intervention.


_**Conclusions and Implications**_
All of the studies reviewed were actively trying to reduce
BMI, weight-for-height, or body fat through behavior
change. As such, the studies reviewed met SmiciklasWright and D’Augelli’s call for “programs which involve
individuals in a careful, active change of problematic
health-related behaviors” (59) by using several types of
social strategies for their interventions. Among the studies
here, the variables exhibiting significant change were
weight status, energy intake or percentage of calories from
saturated fat, TV viewing time, maternal restriction of child
feeding, and serum cholesterol. These studies provide a
strong base to further develop effective interventions.
Clearly, more interventions need to be implemented and
evaluated. A first step would be to evaluate the effectiveness
of the preceding interventions among other racial/ethnic
groups and in other settings.
Our finding that five of the seven interventions reviewed
used multicomponent strategies, and the interventions used
a variety of settings and frequently included parents as
agents of change, could be considered a model coincident
with the Institute of Medicine’s recommendation that because obesity has a variety of causes, a multicomponent
intervention program, focusing on more than one strategy,


Obesity in Preschool Children, Bluford, Sherry, and Scanlon


using a variety of settings, and involving parents and other
adults such as teachers, is likely to be more effective in
preventing overweight (60).
It seems prudent to recommend that interventions for
children include parents and other adult models (e.g., teachers) rather than children alone. Standardizing the definition
of obesity and categorization of outcome measures would
greatly facilitate comparison of studies. Longer follow-up
periods of at least 1 or 2 years to assess change in weight
status may increase the likelihood of adequately evaluating
program impact and sustainability of the program’s impact.
In conclusion, there are great opportunities for further work
in developing and evaluating intervention programs to prevent or treat overweight among preschool children.
