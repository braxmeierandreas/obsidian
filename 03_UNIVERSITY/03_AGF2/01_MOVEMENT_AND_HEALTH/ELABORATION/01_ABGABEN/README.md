# Abgaben (Submissions)

This folder is intended to store your final submissions for assignments, projects, or any work to be handed in for this module.

It is good practice to:
- Include the assignment name and date in the filename (e.g., `Assignment_1_Final_2025-12-22.pdf`).
- Keep a clean record of what has been submitted.
- Avoid storing drafts here; use the designated draft folders instead.
