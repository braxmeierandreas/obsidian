**Background**


Lay health workers (LHWs) perform functions related to healthcare delivery, receive some level of training, but have no formal professional
or paraprofessional certificate or tertiary education degree. They provide care for a range of issues, including maternal and child health. For
LHW programmes to be effective, we need a better understanding of the factors that influence their success and sustainability. This review
addresses these issues through a synthesis of qualitative evidence and was carried out alongside the Cochrane review of the effectiveness
of LHWs for maternal and child health.


**Objectives**


The overall aim of the review is to explore factors affecting the implementation of LHW programmes for maternal and child health.


**Search methods**


We searched MEDLINE, OvidSP (searched 21 December 2011); MEDLINE Ovid In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, OvidSP (searched
21 December 2011); CINAHL, EBSCO (searched 21 December 2011); British Nursing Index and Archive, OvidSP (searched 13 May 2011). We
searched reference lists of included studies, contacted experts in the field, and included studies that were carried out alongside the trials
from the LHW effectiveness review.


**Selection criteria**


Studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis and that focused on the experiences and attitudes of stakeholders
regarding LHW programmes for maternal or child health in a primary or community healthcare setting.


**Data collection and analysis**


We identified barriers and facilitators to LHW programme implementation using the framework thematic synthesis approach. Two review
authors independently assessed study quality using a standard tool. We assessed the certainty of the review findings using the CerQual
approach, an approach that we developed alongside this and related qualitative syntheses. We integrated our findings with the outcome

measures included in the review of LHW programme effectiveness in a logic model. Finally, we identified hypotheses for subgroup analyses
in future updates of the review of effectiveness.


**Main results**


We included 53 studies primarily describing the experiences of LHWs, programme recipients, and other health workers. LHWs in
high income countries mainly offered promotion, counselling and support. In low and middle income countries, LHWs offered similar
services but sometimes also distributed supplements, contraceptives and other products, and diagnosed and treated children with
common childhood diseases. Some LHWs were trained to manage uncomplicated labour and to refer women with pregnancy or labour
complications.


Many of the findings were based on studies from multiple settings, but with some methodological limitations. These findings were assessed
as being of moderate certainty. Some findings were based on one or two studies and had some methodological limitations. These were
assessed have low certainty.


Barriers and facilitators were mainly tied to programme acceptability, appropriateness and credibility; and health system constraints.
Programme recipients were generally positive to the programmes, appreciating the LHWs’ skills and the similarities they saw between
themselves and the LHWs. However, some recipients were concerned about confidentiality when receiving home visits. Others saw LHW
services as not relevant or not sufficient, particularly when LHWs only offered promotional services. LHWs and recipients emphasised the
importance of trust, respect, kindness and empathy. However, LHWs sometimes found it difficult to manage emotional relationships and
boundaries with recipients. Some LHWs feared blame if care was not successful. Others felt demotivated when their services were not
appreciated. Support from health systems and community leaders could give LHWs credibility, at least if the health systems and community
leaders had authority and respect. Active support from family members was also important.


Health professionals ofen appreciated the LHWs’ contributions in reducing their workload and for their communication skills and
commitment. However, some health professionals thought that LHWs added to their workload and feared a loss of authority.


LHWs were motivated by factors including altruism, social recognition, knowledge gain and career development. Some unsalaried LHWs
wanted regular payment, while others were concerned that payment might threaten their social status or lead recipients to question their
motives. Some salaried LHWs were dissatisfied with their pay levels. Others were frustrated when payment differed across regions or
institutions. Some LHWs stated that they had few opportunities to voice complaints.


LHWs described insufficient, poor quality, irrelevant and inflexible training programmes, calling for more training in counselling and
communication and in topics outside their current role, including common health problems and domestic problems. LHWs and supervisors
complained about supervisors’ lack of skills, time and transportation. Some LHWs appreciated the opportunity to share experiences with
fellow LHWs.


In some studies, LHWs were traditional birth attendants who had received additional training. Some health professionals were concerned
that these LHWs were over-confident about their ability to manage danger signs. LHWs and recipients pointed to other problems, including
women’s reluctance to be referred afer bad experiences with health professionals, fear of caesarean sections, lack of transport, and cost.
Some LHWs were reluctant to refer women on because of poor co-operation with health professionals.


We organised these findings and the outcome measures included in the review of LHW programme effectiveness in a logic model. Here
we proposed six chains of events where specific programme components lead to specific intermediate or long-term outcomes, and where
specific moderators positively or negatively affect this process. We suggest how future updates of the LHW effectiveness review could
explore whether the presence of these components influences programme success.


**Authors' conclusions**


Rather than being seen as a lesser trained health worker, LHWs may represent a different and sometimes preferred type of health worker.
The close relationship between LHWs and recipients is a programme strength. However, programme planners must consider how to
achieve the benefits of closeness while minimizing the potential drawbacks. Other important facilitators may include the development
of services that recipients perceive as relevant; regular and visible support from the health system and the community; and appropriate
training, supervision and incentives.

**Factors that can influence the success of lay health worker programmes for maternal and child health**


This review was carried out by researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration. It summarises the findings of 53 studies that explore factors
influencing the success of lay health worker (LHW) programmes for mothers and child health. This review was carried out alongside the
Cochrane review assessing the effectiveness of LHW programmes on maternal and child health.

A LHW is a lay person who has received some training to deliver healthcare services but is not a health professional. In most of the studies in
this review, LHWs offered health care to people who were on low incomes living in wealthy countries or to people living in poor countries.
The LHWs in wealthy countries offered health promotion, counselling and support. The LHWs in poor countries offered similar services but
they sometimes also distributed food supplements, contraceptives and other products, treated children with common childhood diseases,
or managed women in uncomplicated labour.


**What the research says**


The studies described the experiences of LHWs, mothers, programme managers, and other health workers with LHW programmes. Many
of our findings were based on studies from different settings and had some methodological problems. We judged these findings to have
moderate certainty. Some findings were only based on one or two studies that had some methodological problems and were judged to
be of low certainty.


Mothers were generally positive about the programmes. They appreciated the LHWs’ skills and the similarities they saw between
themselves and the LHWs. However, some mothers were concerned about confidentiality when receiving home visits. Others saw LHW
services as not relevant or not sufficient, particularly when LHWs only offered promotional services. LHWs and mothers emphasised the
importance of trust, respect, kindness and empathy. However, LHWs sometimes found it difficult to manage emotional relationships and
boundaries with mothers. Some LHWs feared blame if health care was not successful. Others felt demotivated when their services were
not appreciated. Support from health systems and community leaders could give LHWs credibility if these health systems and community
leaders had authority and respect. Active support from family members was also important.


Health professionals ofen appreciated the LHWs' contributions to reducing their workload, and their communication skills and
commitment. However, some health professionals thought that LHWs added to their own workloads and feared a loss of authority.


LHWs were motivated by altruism, social recognition, knowledge gain and career development. Some unsalaried LHWs wanted regular
payment. Others were concerned that payment might threaten their social status or lead people to question their motives. Some salaried
LHWs were dissatisfied with their pay levels. Others were frustrated when other LHWs had higher salaries. Some LHWs said that they had
few opportunities to voice complaints.


Some LHWs described insufficient, poor quality and irrelevant training programmes. They called for more training in counselling and
communication and in topics outside their current role, including common health problems and domestic problems. LHWs and supervisors
complained about supervisors’ lack of skills, time and transportation. Some LHWs appreciated the opportunity to share experiences with
other LHWs.


Some LHWs were traditional birth attendants who had received additional training. Some health professionals were concerned that these
LHWs were over-confident about their ability to manage danger signs. LHWs and mothers identified women’s reluctance to be referred
afer bad experiences with health professionals, fear of caesarean sections, lack of transport, and costs. Some LHWs were also reluctant to
refer women on because of poor co-operation with health professionals.


We organized these findings into chains of events where we have proposed how certain LHW programme elements might lead to greater
programme success.


**Authors’ conclusions**


Rather than being seen as a lesser trained health worker, LHWs represent a different and sometimes preferred type of health worker.
The ofen close relationship between LHWs and their recipients is a strength of such programmes. However, programme planners must
consider how to achieve the benefits of closeness while avoiding the problems. It may also be important to offer services that recipients
perceive as relevant; to ensure regular and visible support from other health workers and community leaders; and to offer appropriate
training, supervision and incentives.

The Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6 aim to reduce
child mortality, improve maternal health, and combat HIV/AIDS,
malaria and other diseases. A key obstacle to the achievement
of these goals is the chronic shortage and poor distribution of
health workers in many countries (WHO 2010). One important
approach to this problem is the moving of tasks to health workers
with less training, or 'task-shifing' (sometimes referred to as
'optimising') for instance by transferring certain tasks from doctors
to nurses, midwives, or lay health workers. By re-organising the
health workforce in this way, policy makers hope to make more
efficient use of the human resources already available and thereby
expand and strengthen coverage of key health interventions (WHO
2012; WHO/PEPFAR/UNAIDS 2007).


**Description of the intervention**


Lay health workers (LHWs) perform diverse functions related
to healthcare delivery. While LHWs are usually provided
with job-related training they have no formal professional or
paraprofessional tertiary education, and can be involved in either
paid or voluntary care (Lewin 2005). The term 'lay health worker' is
thus broad in scope and includes, for example, community health
workers, village health workers, treatment supporters and birth
attendants.


The primary healthcare approach adopted by the World Health
Organization (WHO) at Alma-Ata promoted the initiation and
rapid expansion of LHW programmes in low and middle income
country settings, including a number of large national programmes,
in the 1970s (Walt 1990). However, the effectiveness and costs
of such programmes came to be questioned in the following
decade, particularly at national level. Several evaluations were
conducted and these indicated difficulties in the scaling up
of LHW programmes as a consequence of a range of factors.
Important constraints included inadequate training and ongoing
supervision; insecure funding for incentives, equipment and drugs;
failure to integrate LHW initiatives with the formal health system;
poor planning; and opposition from health professionals (Frankel
1992; Walt 1990). These constraints led to poor quality care and
difficulties in retaining trained LHWs in many of the programmes.


The 1990s saw renewed interest in community or LHW programmes
in low and middle income countries. This was prompted by
a number of factors including the growing AIDS epidemic;
the resurgence of other infectious diseases; and the failure of
the formal health system to provide adequate care for people
with chronic illnesses (Hadley 2000; Maher 1999). The growing
emphasis on decentralisation and partnership with communitybased organisations also contributed to this renewed interest. In
high income country settings, a perceived need for mechanisms to
deliver health care to minority communities and to support people
with a wide range of health issues (Hesselink 2009; Witmer 1995) led
to further growth in a variety of LHW interventions.


More recently, the growing focus on the human resource crisis
in health care in many low and middle income countries has
re-energised debates regarding the roles that LHWs may play in
extending services to 'hard to reach' groups and areas, and in
substituting for health professionals for a range of tasks (Chopra
2008; WHO 2005; WHO 2006; WHO 2007). Task shifing is not a new
concept. However, it has been given particular prominence and



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


urgency in the face of the demands placed on health systems, in a
number of settings, by the increased need for treatment of HIV/AIDS
(Hermann 2009; Lehmann 2009; Schneider 2008; Zachariah 2009).
Within this context, it is thought that LHWs may be able to play an
important role in helping to achieve the Millennium Development
Goals for health, particularly for child survival and treatment of
tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS (Chen 2004; Filippi 2006; Haines
2007; Lewin 2008). For example, LHWs may be one route to
expanding the coverage of effective neonatal and child health
interventions, such as exclusive breastfeeding and communitybased case management of pneumonia, which remain under 50%
in many low and middle income countries (Darmstadt 2005).


In contrast to earlier initiatives that tended to focus on generalist
LHWs delivering a range of services within communities, more
recent programmes have ofen been vertical in their approaches.
In these programmes LHWs deliver a single or a small number of
focused interventions addressing a particular health issue, such as
promotion of vaccination; or one aspect of treatment care, such as
supporting treatment adherence for people with tuberculosis (TB)
(Lehmann 2007; Schneider 2008).


**Why it is important to do this review**


The Cochrane review on the effectiveness of LHW programmes
for maternal and child health and infectious diseases (Lewin
2010) identified a total of 82 randomised trials, representing a
substantial body of evidence regarding the effectiveness of these
types of programmes. In these trials, LHWs received a small
amount of training to perform a range of health services, ofen
targeting common causes of childhood mortality and morbidity.
The review concluded that these types of programmes can
effectively deliver key maternal and child health interventions in
primary and community health care, including interventions to
increase childhood immunisation rates and breastfeeding rates.


While the review concluded that this approach is promising,
the results of these trials were heterogeneous, which, given the
complexity of these types of interventions, was not unexpected.
In addition, the level of organisation and support used for these
interventions may have been higher than in real-life settings. If
these types of interventions are to be successfully implemented
and scaled up, we need a greater understanding of the factors
that may influence their success and sustainability. These include
the values, preferences, knowledge and skills of stakeholders, and
the feasibility and applicability of the intervention for particular
settings and healthcare systems (see Table 1 for an overview
of factors affecting implementation). While Cochrane reviews of
effectiveness are not designed to answer these types of questions,
there is growing acknowledgement that syntheses of qualitative
research can address questions such as these.


It is also increasingly recognised that bringing together qualitative
studies in one synthesis can add value by allowing us to see both
similarities and differences that exist across various contexts. As
with systematic reviews of effectiveness, syntheses of qualitative
data should be carried out in a systematic and transparent way. The
last few years have seen strong development in the methodology
for synthesising data from multiple qualitative studies, including
within The Cochrane Collaboration (Noyes 2009), and the Cochrane
Qualitative Research Methods Group has identified around 500
such syntheses.

While high quality syntheses of qualitative evidence can on their
own prove valuable to researchers and policymakers, pairing
qualitative syntheses with systematic reviews of (quantitative)
effectiveness data allows for even more comprehensive insights
into single topic areas. At least one Cochrane review has previously
prompted a 'matching' synthesis of qualitative data. The Cochrane
review of directly observed therapy (DOT) versus self-administered
treatment for adherence to TB treatment showed that DOT, despite
its widespread use, does not achieve better outcomes (Volmink
2007). Two parallel reviews, both co-authored by members of
the current research team (Munro 2007; Noyes 2007), searched
for qualitative studies on factors explaining non-adherence to TB
treatment. Together, these syntheses of qualitative research not
only provided supporting evidence regarding the intervention’s
lack of effect but also helped explain this lack of effect and
informed policy and the design of more appropriate interventions
(Garner 2007). Qualitative evidence also helped to clarify the
many ofen context-specific barriers and facilitators to accessing
and complying with complex interventions to promote medicines
management and treatment.


Pairing reviews of effectiveness with reviews of qualitative studies
is equally relevant in the field of health workforce interventions,
and a large body of relevant qualitative research exists. This
research has described barriers and facilitators to the success of
interventions targeting different aspects of human resources for
health. These barriers and facilitators include the attitudes and
experience of the health workers themselves and also those of
other stakeholders such as the health professionals they work
with or whose tasks they have taken over, and the communities
they serve. On the one hand, health workers taking on new tasks
may appreciate the opportunity to be more useful as well as to
gain increased salaries and public recognition (De Brouwere 2009).
On the other hand, task shifing may not be accompanied by
sufficient supervision or compensation and can create confusion,
role conflicts and competition between health worker groups (De
Brouwere 2009; Yakan 2009).


Previously we had attempted to identify all qualitative studies that
were carried out alongside the 82 trials included in the review of
LHW programme effectiveness. We did this by contacting authors of
all the included trials, checking papers for references to qualitative
research, searching PubMed for related studies, and carrying out
citation searches. However, we were only able to find qualitative
research that had been done during or afer the trial for 14 (17%)
of the trials (Glenton 2011). In addition, descriptions of qualitative
methods and results were ofen sparse. Therefore, we decided to
look for qualitative studies that explored LHW programmes either
alongside or outside a trial context.


This review is one of a series of reviews that aimed to
inform the World Health Organization's 'Recommendations for
Optimizing Health Worker Roles to Improve Access to key
Maternal and Newborn Health Interventions through Task
Shifing' (OPTIMIZEMNH) (WHO 2012).


**O B J E C T I V E S**


The overall aim of the review is to explore factors affecting
the implementation of lay health worker (LHW) programmes for
maternal and child health.


The review has the following objectives:



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


- to identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative research
evidence on the barriers and facilitators to the implementation
of LHW programmes for maternal and child health;

- to integrate the findings of this review with the findings of the
Cochrane review of effectiveness of LHW programmes (Lewin
2013) so as to enhance and extend our understanding of how
these complex interventions work, and how context impacts on
implementation;

- to identify hypotheses for undertaking subgroup analyses in
future updates of the Cochrane review of the effectiveness of
LHW programmes (Lewin 2013).


**M E T H O D S**


**Criteria for considering studies for this review**


**Types of studies**


We included studies that used qualitative study designs such
as ethnographic research, case studies, process evaluations and
mixed methods designs. We included these studies if they had used
qualitative methods for data collection (including focus group and
individual interviews, observation, and document analysis) and
qualitative methods for data analysis (including thematic analysis
or any other appropriate qualitative analysis method that enabled
analysis of text and observations and narrative presentation of
findings). We therefore excluded studies that had collected data
using qualitative methods but had analysed these data using
quantitative methods.


**Types of participants**


We included studies that focused on the experiences and attitudes
of stakeholders about lay health worker programmes in any
country. Participants could include lay health workers, patients and
their families, policy makers, programme managers, other health
workers, or any others involved in or affected by the programmes.


**Types of interventions**


We included studies of programmes that were delivered in a
primary or community healthcare setting; that intend to improve
maternal or child health; and that had used any type of lay
health worker, including community health workers, village health
workers, birth attendants, peer counsellors, nutrition workers and
home visitors.


For the purpose of this review, we defined a lay health worker as
any health worker who:


- performs functions related to healthcare delivery,

- is trained in some way in the context of the intervention, but

- has received no formal professional or paraprofessional
certificate or tertiary education degree (Lewin 2005).


We defined maternal and child health care as follows:


- child health: health care aimed at improving the health of
children aged less than five years

- maternal health: health care aimed at improving reproductive
health, ensuring safe motherhood, or directed at women in their
role as carers for children aged less than five years (Lewin 2010)

We included studies where services were delivered in a hospital
setting if they also included a primary or community health care
component.


While the Cochrane intervention review also evaluated the
effectiveness of lay health worker programmes on infectious
diseases, we decided not to include this topic in the current
synthesis of qualitative evidence so as to make it more manageable.


**Types of outcome measures**


_**Phenomena of interest**_


We included studies where the primary focus was the experiences
and attitudes of stakeholders towards lay health worker
programmes.


**Search methods for identification of studies**


**Electronic searches**


We searched the following electronic databases for eligible studies:


- MEDLINE IN-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations December
20, 2011, OvidSP (searched 21.12.11)

- MEDLINE, 1948 to November Week 3 2011, OvidSP (searched
21.12.11)

- British Nursing Index and Archive, 1985 to May 2011, OvidSP
(searched 13.05.11)

- CINAHL, 1981 to present, EbscoHost (searched 21.12.11).


A search strategy had previously been developed for the Cochrane
review of lay health worker programme effectiveness (Lewin
2010), including a comprehensive list of terms used in the
literature to describe lay health worker interventions. We used
these terms but removed the methods filter that was used to
identify randomised trials. When searching MEDLINE (Appendix
1) and CINAHL (Appendix 2), we instead made use of their filter
for qualitative studies, choosing the “specificity” alternative for
MEDLINE and the “Qualitative – Best balance” alternative for
CINAHL. When searching the British Nursing Index (Appendix 3), we
used terms based on the MEDLINE methods filter.


We limited searches to English for feasibility reasons, given that it
would be extremely time-consuming and costly to undertake full
text translation into English of qualitative papers for inclusion in
this synthesis.


**Other sources**


In addition to the electronic searches, we contacted experts in
the field, and searched reference lists of included studies. We
also included studies that we had previously identified as having
been carried out alongside the trials from the lay health worker
programme effectiveness review (Glenton 2011).


**Data collection and analysis**


**Selection of studies**


Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts
of the identified records to evaluate their eligibility. The full text
of all the papers identified as potentially relevant by one or both
review authors were retrieved. These papers were then assessed
independently by two review authors. Disagreements between the
review authors was resolved via discussion or, when required,



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


by seeking a third review author's view. Where appropriate, we
contacted the study authors for further information.


While systematic reviews of intervention effectiveness aim to
include all relevant trials in order to avoid bias, this is not
necessarily the case for syntheses of qualitative studies. In fact, too
great a number of included studies can threaten the quality of data
analysis, although there are few guidelines as to the ideal number
of papers to include. In addition, the purpose of these syntheses
is interpretive explanation rather than predictive (Doyle 2003), and
"the results of a conceptual synthesis will not change if ten rather
than five studies contain the same concept, but will depend on the
range of concepts found in the studies, their context, and whether
they are in agreement or not" (Thomas 2008). It may therefore be
unnecessary to locate every available study and review authors
may aim for a sample that is purposive rather than exhaustive
(Doyle 2003).


Following from this standpoint, we utilised purposive sampling in
order to arrive at a group of studies that provided geographical
coverage. By achieving this coverage, we hoped to ensure a greater
variation in contexts and thereby greater conceptual diversity. This
aim of achieving geographical coverage was also driven by the
fact that the review was developed to complement the review
of lay health worker programme effectiveness, which included
studies from several regions of the world. An additional reason was
that the OPTIMIZEMNH guidance that our review aimed to inform
was global, and geographical coverage was therefore regarded as
helpful. However, we were concerned that our exclusion of studies
in languages other than English would negatively affect this goal.
Afer our initial round of study inclusion, we saw that studies
from North America and UK were well-represented while we had
few studies from Latin America. We therefore decided that when
we were in doubt about the inclusion of a particular study, we
would be lenient towards studies from Latin America while we
would be particularly stringent towards studies from North America
and the UK. In most cases, this meant being particularly stringent
about our requirement that studies should have as their primary
focus the experiences and attitudes of stakeholders towards lay
health worker programmes. The same requirement was applied
particularly leniently for Latin American studies. In a few cases, we
also applied the definition of “healthcare” stringently for studies
from North America and the UK, excluding a few studies where lay
health workers focused on child accident prevention and on social
support, for instance support for parents of children with special
needs. Finally, we excluded a small number of studies from the
UK because they overlapped greatly with other studies in terms
of the topics and settings covered (See Characteristics of excluded
studies).


**Data extraction and management**


We developed a data extraction form that was informed
by the SURE framework (The SURE Collaboration 2011) (See
Table 1 for an overview of the key domains of the SURE
framework). This framework focuses on barriers to implementing
health systems changes and includes the following factors:
(a) knowledge and skills; attitudes regarding programme
acceptability, appropriateness and credibility; and motivation
to change or adopt new behaviours among recipients of care,
providers of care, and other stakeholders; (b) health system
constraints (including accessibility of care, financial resources,
human resources, educational system, clinical supervision, internal

communication, external communication, allocation of authority,
accountability, management or leadership (or both), information
systems, facilities, patient flow processes, procurement and
distribution systems, incentives, bureaucracy, and relationship
with norms and standards); and (c) social and political constraints
(including ideology, short-term thinking, contracts, legislation
or regulations, donor policies, influential people, corruption,
and political stability). In syntheses of qualitative research, the
"informants" are the authors of the individual studies rather than
the participants in these studies. The authors' interpretations,
presented for instance through themes and categories, therefore
represent our data. While the authors' interpretations were
primarily collected from the results sections of each paper, author
interpretations were sometimes also found in the discussion
sections, and these were also extracted when relevant and when
well-supported by data.


We also extracted information concerning the first author’s name;
year of publication; language; country of study; clinical area; study
setting (primary health centre or community; rural / urban, etc).


**Assessment of risk of bias in included studies**


As this is a synthesis of qualitative studies, we did not carry out
any assessment of risk of bias for the included studies. Instead, we
assessed the quality of the included studies as described below.


**Assessment of the quality of the included qualitative studies**


Our inclusion criteria specified that studies needed to use both
qualitative data collection and analysis methods. This criterion also
constituted a basic quality threshold. In addition, and following
Cochrane Qualitative Research Methods Group guidance (Noyes



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


2011), two researchers independently applied a set of quality
criteria to each included study. Disagreements were then resolved
by seeking a third review author's view. Appraisal was performed
using some of the main elements of the Critical Appraisal Skills
Programme (CASP) quality assessment tool for qualitative studies
(CASP 2006), as in other syntheses of qualitative evidence (Carlsen
2007; Munro 2007). See Table 2 for an overview of the quality criteria
used.


We included studies that met our inclusion criteria regardless
of study quality. We used the quality assessment when judging
the relative contribution of each study to the development of
explanations and relationships, as described in more detail below.
It has been noted that poorer quality studies tend to contribute less
to the synthesis (Atkins 2008). Therefore, the synthesis becomes
‘‘weighted’’ towards the findings of the better quality studies. Also,
there is currently no consensus among qualitative researchers
on the role of quality criteria and how they should be applied,
and there is ongoing debate about how study quality should be
assessed for the purposes of systematic reviews (Atkins 2008).


_**Appraisal of certainty of review findings**_


GRADE is now an accepted approach to assessing the certainty
of findings from reviews of effectiveness (Guyatt 2011). However,
few methods for assessing the certainty of findings drawn
from syntheses of qualitative evidence have been developed.
In connection with the development this synthesis and other
syntheses of qualitative research (Colvin 2013; Rashidian 2013)
carried out to inform the WHO OPTIMIZEMNH recommendations,
we therefore chose to develop a system which we refer to as the
CerQual (certainty of the qualitative evidence) approach (Figure 1).

**Figure 1.  The CerQual approach**


In the CerQual approach our assessment of certainty is based on
two factors: the _methodological limitations_ of the individual studies
contributing to a review finding and the _coherence_ of each review
finding.


_Assessing methodological limitations_ : Findings that are drawn from
well-conducted studies can be regarded as more dependable
(Lincoln 1985). We therefore appraised how well the individual
studies which contributed to the evidence of a review finding
were conducted _,_ using an adaptation of the Critical Appraisal
Skills Programme (CASP) quality-assessment tool for qualitative
studies (CASP 2006), as described above. When several studies
with varied methodological limitations contributed to a finding, we
made an overall judgment about the distribution of strengths and
weaknesses in the studies to come to an assessment of the overall
methodological limitations.


_Assessing coherence_ : We assessed the _coherence_ of each review
finding by looking at the extent to which we were able to identify a
clear pattern across the data contributed by each of the individual
studies. This pattern could be assessed as clear in circumstances
where the review finding was consistent across multiple contexts
_or_ where the review finding incorporated explanations for any
variations across individual studies. The coherence of the review
findings could be further strengthened where the individual studies



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


contributing to the finding were drawn from a wide range of
settings.


We assessed the certainty of each review finding as either high,
moderate or low. A review finding drawn from generally wellconducted studies with few methodological limitations – and
showing high levels of coherence – was rated as high certainty.
A review finding where there were concerns regarding either the
methodological limitations of the studies or the coherence of the
finding was assessed as moderate certainty. Where the studies
had important methodological limitations and where there were
concerns regarding the coherence of the review finding, this finding
was assessed as being of low certainty.


CerQual is similar to GRADE (Guyatt 2011) in that both approaches
aim to assess the _certainty_ of (or confidence in) the evidence, and
both also rate this certainty for each finding across studies rather
than for each individual study. GRADE also bases its assessment
on a combination of the quality of the evidence and other factors,
including consistency across studies. However, GRADE is designed
to assess the certainty of evidence regarding the _effectiveness of_
_an intervention_, and is not suitable when appraising the certainty
of qualitative evidence. The CerQual approach is also similar to
an approach used by Goldsmith et al (Goldsmith 2007). In their
synthesis of qualitative research, they assess the overall quality of
the evidence for each individual finding by evaluating the quality,

consistency and directness of the evidence. We have chosen not to
refer to the directness of the evidence as it can be argued that, in
the context of qualitative evidence syntheses, this dimension needs
to be assessed by the end-user of the evidence.


**Data synthesis**


We analysed and synthesised qualitative evidence using the
framework thematic synthesis approach (Booth 2012). Thematic
synthesis is one of several approaches recommended by the
Cochrane Qualitative Review Methods Group (Noyes 2011) and may
be particularly appropriate where evidence is likely to offer only
thin description and is likely to be largely descriptive as opposed
to highly theorised or conceptual. In the framework approach, the
thematic synthesis is guided by an a priori theoretical framework.
Framework synthesis has five stages:


- _Familiarisation:_ immersion in the included studies with the aims
and objectives of the review.

- _Identifying a thematic framework_ : Rather than develop our
own a priori framework afer reading the included studies,
we opted to use the SURE framework described above (The
SURE Collaboration 2011) as an a priori framework of themes
and categories. We used this framework to guide our analysis
for two reasons. Firstly, it provided us with a comprehensive
list of possible factors that could influence intervention
implementation. Secondly, the current synthesis is one of four
syntheses of qualitative research that have informed the World
Health Organization's OPTIMIZEMNH Guidelines (WHO 2012).
The use of the SURE Framework across these syntheses made
it possible to carry out an overarching analysis of factors
influencing optimisation among different health worker groups.

- _Indexing_ : Four review authors independently read and re-read
the selected studies and applied the SURE framework, moving
between the data and the themes covered by the framework,
but also searching for additional themes until all the studies had
been reviewed. The definitions and boundaries of each of the
emerging themes were discussed among the authors. The SURE
framework was then revised in line with the ideas and categories
that emerged.

- _Charting:_ We then developed the thematic synthesis further
by rearranging data according to the appropriate part of the
thematic framework to which they related, and formed charts.
Our charts contained distilled summaries of evidence from
different stakeholder perspectives and involved a high level of
abstraction and synthesis. At the charting and mapping stage
we used a cross-case analysis approach (Miles 1994) to explore
whether there were differences between high, middle and low
income countries in the barriers and facilitators we identified,
and whether studies of trained traditional birth attendants



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


differed from studies of other types of lay health workers. Any
differences that were identified were indicated in the text of the
results.

- _Mapping and interpretation:_ Using the charts we then defined
concepts, mapped the range and nature of phenomena, created
typologies and found associations between themes as a way
of developing explanations for the findings. The process of
mapping and interpretation was influenced by the original
review objectives as well as by the themes that have emerged
from the data.


See Table 3 for an overview of the data synthesis process.


**Summary of qualitative findings tables**


Afer organising the data into themes and concepts, we
summarised these findings in a summary of qualitative findings
table. This table is similar to “Summary of Findings” tables used in
Cochrane reviews of effectiveness and summarise the key findings
and the certainty of evidence for each finding, and also provide an
explanation of the assessment of the certainty of the qualitative
evidence.


**Parallel synthesis of the qualitative evidence and the**
**intervention review**


One of the objectives of the current synthesis was to integrate its
findings with those of the effectiveness review. However, this type
of integration is still a relatively novel approach without agreedupon standards or methods.


We decided to use a logic model approach to achieve this aim.
The aim of a logic model is not to prove causal links between
programme or policy elements and outcomes, but simply to
present theories or assumptions about these links. There is no
uniform template for developing logic models, although the most
common approach involves identifying a logical flow that starts
with specific planned inputs and activities and ends with specific
outcomes or impacts, ofen with short-term or intermediate
outcomes along the way.


Two authors (CG, SL) went through the findings from the summary
of qualitative findings table and organized these findings into
several chains of events that we propose might ultimately lead
to the outcomes explored in the effectiveness review. Firstly, we
categorised findings from the qualitative synthesis and outcome
measures from the effectiveness review as one of the following:


- A _**component**_ or planned element of the lay health worker
programme (see Figure 2). All components were based on
information from the synthesis of qualitative research.

- An _**intermediate outcome**_ that the components might lead
to (see Figure 2). Intermediate outcomes were based on
information from the synthesis of qualitative research or were
based on outcome measures that had been identified a priori as
relevant in the review of effectiveness.

- A _**longer-term outcome**_ that the components might ultimately
lead to (see Figure 2). All longer-term outcomes were based on
outcome measures that had been identified a priori as relevant
in the review of effectiveness.

- A _**moderator,**_ i.e. a factor that could affect, either positively
or negatively, the relationship between a component and
the intermediate or longer term outcome (see Figure 2). All
moderators were based on information from the synthesis of
qualitative research.


We then organised these elements into chains of events. This was
an iterative process, and we developed several versions before
agreeing on the model. All authors then commented on the draf
model before it was finalised.


In the final model, components, moderators and intermediate
outcomes that were based on evidence from the qualitative
synthesis were shaded blue. Intermediate outcomes and longerterm outcomes that were taken from the effectiveness review were
shaded green.



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


The process of categorising the findings in the qualitative synthesis
as components, moderators or intermediate outcomes involved
varying degrees of imputation. When describing programme
components, we sometimes re-phrased “negative” findings as
“positive” findings. For instance, one of the findings states that
lay health workers expressed frustration where payment differed
across regions or institutions. We re-phrased this in the logic
model and presented “consistent lay health worker incentives” as
a programme component. Moderators and intermediate outcomes
also varied in the extent to which they were direct interpretations of
the synthesis findings. For some, a degree of imputation was used.
Where feasible, we have indicated which findings each element was
base on by referring to the reference number of the relevant finding
in the summary of qualitative findings table.

**Results of the search**


We identified a total of 7684 titles and abstracts and considered
179 full text papers for inclusion in this synthesis. Fify-three studies
of LHW programmes, described in 56 papers, were included in the

_**Study respondents**_


In almost all of the studies, authors sought the perspectives
of the LHWs themselves, although many studies also included
programme recipients as respondents. Other respondents included
health professionals working with the LHWs, programme staff,
supervisors, community leaders and policy makers.



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


_**Setting**_


Seventeen of the LHW programmes were based in low income
countries (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Gambia, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal,
Uganda, Viet Nam, Zambia, Zimbabwe); 19 programmes were
based in middle income countries (Brazil, Ghana, Guatemala,
Honduras, India, Iran, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Papua New
Guinea, South Africa, Thailand); and 17 programmes were based
in high income countries (Australia, Canada, USA, UK). These
assignments are based on the World Bank’s 2011 classification
(World Bank 2011).

Most of the programmes from high income countries took place in
urban settings and recipients ofen belonged to particular social
groups, such as immigrants or refugees, families living in temporary
accommodation, or teenage mothers. The programmes from low
and middle income countries took place in both urban and rural
settings, although most were in rural settings, and recipients were
generally regarded as particularly in need of more accessible
healthcare services.


The programmes were run by either non-government organisations
(NGOs) or local and national governments, or a collaboration of
these, and ranged from small pilot programmes to large-scale
national programmes.


In 42 of the programmes the LHWs delivered services to people
in their homes, in the community, or in both homes and the
community. In the remaining 11 programmes, LHWs delivered
services in health facilities although ofen in combination with
home or community-based services.


_**Healthcare services**_


The healthcare services that LHWs delivered were generally
poorly described and precise information was hard to obtain.
LHWs provided services ranging from promotional and ofen
relatively simple tasks to more complex sometimes curative tasks.
LHW programmes from high income countries primarily provided
promotional services. Where more complex, curative tasks were
performed, or where medicines or contraceptives were distributed,
this took place in low and middle income countries.


**Promotion, counselling and support**


In all of the studies from high income countries, as well as some
studies from low and middle income countries, LHWs were used for
promotion, counselling and support.


In six studies, the LHWs' main task was to offer breastfeeding
advice and support. Four of these studies were from the UK (Beake
2005; Curtis 2007; Raine 2003) and the USA (Meier 2007), while
two studies were from Uganda (Nankunda 2006) and South Africa
(Daniels 2010). In the South African study, LHWs worked in the
context of high HIV/AIDS prevalence and offered advice about both
breastfeeding and bottle feeding in addition to promoting HIV
testing and counselling.


In four USA-based studies (Behnke 2002; Hazard 2009; Korfmacher
2002; Low 2006b), LHWs gave teenage mothers and others in
difficult socioeconomic circumstances emotional and practical
support, and promoted healthy behaviours during pregnancy,
childbirth and in the first few weeks afer birth. In Australia, LHWs
offered emotional and practical support to parents at risk of child
abuse and neglect (Taggart 2000).


In approximately 13 studies, from Australia (Downie 2004), Canada
(Heaman 2006; Woodgate 2007), UK (Murphy 2008; Perkins 2001;
Smith 2007), USA (Sheppard 2004; Warrick 1992), Brazil (Wayland
2002), Mexico (Ramirez-Valles 2003), India (Alcock 2009), Papua
New Guinea (Ashwell 2009) and Viet Nam (Hendrickson 2002), LHWs
carried out a package of tasks that were primarily promotional, and
mainly involved information and advice about topics such as family
planning, pregnancy and childbirth, breastfeeding, vaccinations
and other aspects of newborn and child health care.



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


In one Malawi-based study (Mkandawire 2005), LHWs cared for
people with chronic illnesses, including those with HIV/AIDs,
assisting them with household chores, accompanying them to
hospital, and offering HIV counselling. In another study, in South
Africa (Malema 2010), LHWs offered counselling and testing as a way
of preventing of mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDs.


**Promotion and distribution**


In one Kenyan study, LHWs promoted and sold iron supplements
and other micronutrients (Suchdev 2010). In three studies, based
in Kenya (Kaler 2001), Ethiopia (Mekonnen 2008) and Uganda
(Siu 2009), LHWs offered information about family planning and
reproductive health. In the Kenyan and Ethiopian studies, the LHWs
also distributed family planning methods.


**Diagnosis and treatment**


In Ghana, LHWs diagnosed and treated children with
uncomplicated malaria, and referred children on if the condition
worsened or if severe malaria was suspected (Chinbuah 2006).


**Packages of promotional, preventive and curative tasks**


In many studies LHWs delivered packages of assigned tasks.
However, these tasks were ofen poorly specified and the following
descriptions of task packages only give an approximation of their
contents.


In approximately 11 studies, from Bangladesh (Khan 1998;
Rashid 2001; Simmons 1990), Brazil (Lancman 2009), Honduras
(McQuestion 2010), Iran (Javanparast 2009), Nepal (Glenton
2010), Nicaragua (George 2009), Pakistan (Haq 2009), South
Africa (Mathews 1994) and Thailand (Kaufmann 1997), LHWs
carried out a package of tasks that were primarily promotional
but that also included the delivery of preventive and curative
healthcare interventions. These tasks included the distribution
of contraceptives, iron supplements, vitamin A supplements,
deworming tablets, polio vaccines, and tetanus vaccines to children
or pregnant women; tuberculosis (TB) management; diagnosis and
management of malnutrition; provision of first aid treatment for
accidental wounds and injuries; and the diagnosis and treatment of
common childhood illnesses, including diarrhoea and pneumonia.


In approximately 11 studies, from Bangladesh (Dynes 2011),
Ethiopia (Sibley 2006), Gambia (bij de Vaate 2002), Guatemala
(Hinojosa 2004; Maupin 2008), Honduras (Low 2006), Malawi
(Bisika 2008), Pakistan (Islam 2001), Papua New Guinea (Bettiol
2004), Zambia (Ngoma 2009) and Zimbabwe (Mathole 2005), LHWs
delivered a number of promotional tasks tied to maternal and child
health care, but some, ofen traditional birth attendants, were also
trained to manage uncomplicated labour and to detect high risk
pregnancies and labour complications so that timely referral could
be made.


_**Lay health worker (LHW) selection, training, supervision and**_
_**incentives**_


Information about how the LHWs were selected was ofen lacking.
However, with very few exceptions, LHWs were local women. About
a third of the studies specified that the LHWs were expected to
have either a secondary level education or some level of literacy,
while in at least seven studies this was not a requirement and LHWs
were ofen illiterate or only semi-literate. Other common selection
criteria were that the person should be respected and trusted in

the community, should be married or have children, and should
have particular personal traits such as communication skills, life
experience, a willingness to learn, and an eagerness to work. In
eight studies, the LHWs were traditional birth attendants from
the community. The involvement of community members in the
selection of the LHWs and in other aspects of the programmes was
generally poorly described in the included studies. However, in at
least 10 studies the community had been involved in the selection
of LHWs.


Information about levels of training and supervision was also
ofen lacking. Where this information was available, LHWs received
between a few days and three months training, although two
to three weeks, sometimes with refresher training, was most
common. Information about levels of supervision and who
provided this supervision was even less frequent, but in several
cases supervision was provided by nurses or nurse-midwives, ofen
from the health facility to which the LHWs were attached.


Some information about incentives was given in about two-thirds
of the studies. In at least 11 studies, LHWs received some sort of
direct financial compensation for the work they carried out, for
instance through a fixed monthly salary or stipend, payment by
the hour, or according to the number of women they had visited.
This was most common in high income countries. In two studies,
LHWs kept the profit from the supplements they had sold. In at
least 17 studies, it appeared that LHWs were not salaried, although
they ofen received other types of monetary and non-monetary
incentives, including lunch money, travel money, access to microcredit, childcare and bicycles. In three or four of these studies,
there was some expectation that the LHWs would be paid in cash
or kind by recipients or by the community, for instance the village
development committee.


**Risk of bias in included studies**


We did not perform a risk of bias assessment for the included
studies as this is not an appropriate method for qualitative
research. Instead, we appraised the quality of each study and the
certainty of the review findings using approaches deemed relevant
for qualitative research.


**The quality of the included qualitative studies**


Almost all of the included studies were published as papers
in health research journals, leading to word limitations not
particularly well suited for reporting of qualitative research. In
general, studies gave some description of the strategies they
had used to select participants and to collect and analyse data,
although these descriptions tended to be brief. Most of the studies
used interview or focus group methods, with very few instances of
long-term ethnographic research. Few of the studies included any
discussion of reflexivity. While we ofen assessed findings as being
supported by the data, the descriptions of study context and the
presentation of findings were relatively short. The general lack of
'thick description' may have been due to the choice of methods
and the limitations set by the journals in which the studies were
published (see also Table 2).


**Certainty of the review findings**


As described in the methods section, we used the CerQual
approach to assess the certainty of each review finding, grading
each finding as either of high, moderate or low certainty. None of



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


the study findings were assessed to be of high certainty, because of
weaknesses in study quality. We assessed a little less than half of
the findings as of moderate certainty because the findings showed
high levels of coherence, while we assessed a little more than half
of the findings to be of low certainty because of concerns regarding
both the coherence of the findings and the quality of the underlying
studies.


**Effects of interventions**


Lay health worker (LHW) programme effectiveness has been
assessed in another Cochrane review (Lewin 2013).


Here we present three analyses:


1. a framework synthesis, where we present the barriers and
facilitators to the implementation of LHW programmes for maternal
and child health;


2. a logic model, where we bring together the results of the
qualitative and quantitative reviews;


3. an overview of hypotheses that are based on the logic model and
that could serve as a basis for subgroup analyses in the review of
LHW effectiveness.


**1. The framework synthesis**


Our first and main objective was to identify barriers and facilitators
to LHW programme implementation. Our findings are presented
here and are summarised in the summary of qualitative findings
tables (Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9).


_**Programme acceptability, appropriateness and credibility: the**_
_**lay health worker (LHW)-recipient relationship**_


**Close relationships and being based in the community ofen**
**appreciated by recipients**


Programme recipients in both high, middle and low income
countries were generally very positive to the LHW programmes
(Chinbuah 2006; Dynes 2011; George 2009; Haq 2009; Hazard
2009; Heaman 2006; Islam 2001; Javanparast 2009; Kaler 2001;
Korfmacher 2002; Mathews 1994; Meier 2007; Murphy 2008;
Nankunda 2006; Perkins 2001; Rashid 2001; Sheppard 2004; Siu
2009; Smith 2007; Taggart 2000; Warrick 1992; Woodgate 2007).
Central to programme acceptability were aspects tied to the
closeness of the LHW-recipient relationship and the communitybased nature of the programmes.


**LHW–recipient relationship**


Recipients referred to a number of characteristics which they
appreciated in the LHWs, including their respect, kindness and
concern, and their non-dogmatic approach (Beake 2005; Bisika
2008; Chinbuah 2006; George 2009; Heaman 2006; Mathole 2005).
In programmes from high income countries in particular, recipients
emphasised the importance of LHWs as a source of emotional
and social support (Beake 2005; Hazard 2009; Heaman 2006;
Korfmacher 2002; Mathews 1994; Meier 2007; Murphy 2008; Perkins
2001; Sheppard 2004; Taggart 2000; Warrick 1992), and LHWs
were ofen likened to family members or friends (Hazard 2009;
Korfmacher 2002; Meier 2007; Perkins 2001; Sheppard 2004;
Warrick 1992). In one study, utilisation of LHW services was
reported as poor where no friendship bond had developed between
the LHW and the recipient (Murphy 2008).

LHWs ofen mirrored recipients' responses, emphasising the
closeness of their relationship with programme recipients and
seeing this as a strength of the programme (Alcock 2009;Behnke
2002; Hazard 2009; Hendrickson 2002; Korfmacher 2002; Warrick
1992). LHWs in some studies described how trust, empathy and
respect were key in the establishment and maintenance of this
relationship (Heaman 2006; Malema 2010; Meier 2007; Murphy
2008).


**LHWs as peers**


Recipients ofen appreciated the similarities they saw between
themselves and the LHWs, either because they came from the same
community or because they shared similar social backgrounds
(George 2009; Hazard 2009; Kaler 2001; Nankunda 2006; Perkins
2001; Rashid 2001), although recipients in one study stated that this
was not important (Heaman 2006). Utilisation of LHW services was
sometimes reported as poor when LHWs had different cultures or
languages than their target groups (Meier 2007; Murphy 2008).


**Community base**


The LHWs were usually from the communities they worked in and
programme recipients appreciated the accessibility and availability
of the LHWs. Recipients emphasised the amount of time that
LHWs were able to spend with recipients, the continuity of care
(Beake 2005; Murphy 2008), the fact that the LHWs could offer them
services at any time and within easy reach (Bisika 2008; Chinbuah
2006; George 2009; Javanparast 2009; Mathews 1994; Mathole 2005;
Rashid 2001), and the fact that services were either free or relatively
cheap (George 2009;Javanparast 2009; Rashid 2001). For LHWs
themselves, this community base ofen gave them the flexibility to
fit their tasks around their regular activities, including work in the
fields and household chores (Glenton 2010; Nankunda 2006).


**LHWs compared to health professionals**


Many recipients experienced interactions with LHWs as more
favourable than their experiences with health professionals. In
addition to the practical problems associated with visits to
health professionals, such as greater distances, higher prices,
longer queues and less time (Chinbuah 2006; Rashid 2001;
Simmons 1990), health professionals were described as being too
dogmatic or unrealistic (Beake 2005), “trying to tell them what to
do” (Beake 2005), less trustworthy (Sheppard 2004), less friendly
and concerned (Alcock 2009; Mathole 2005), more intimidating
(Rashid 2001; Taggart 2000), and with disrespectful attitudes to
their patients (Kaler 2001; Mathews 1994; Ngoma 2009; Simmons
1990). In one study the lack of privacy at clinics and the use of
male health workers were also referred to as a problem (Simmons
1990). Recipients, LHWs and programme staff sometimes saw the
LHW as an advocate for programme recipients (Meier 2007; Warrick
1992) and as a bridge between the community and the health
services (Ashwell 2009; Hazard 2009; Mekonnen 2008; Simmons
1990; Taggart 2000).


**Access to other options**


In one study, however, recipients claimed that LHWs were not
necessary because the village was so close to town and they
therefore had easy access to health professionals (Kaufmann 1997).
In another study villagers also had good access to doctors, and
LHWs claimed that the villagers preferred to go to an educated
rather than an uneducated health worker (Khan 1998). In one
study villagers appreciated trained traditional birth attendants and



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


stated that they needed their services but would have preferred to
have access to health professionals (Ngoma 2009).


**Close relationships and being based in the community could lead to**
**problems for lay health workers (LHWs)**


The closeness of the LHW-recipient relationship and the
community-based nature of the programmes gave a number
of benefits to programme recipients, and in part to the LHWs
themselves, but these aspects of the programme were not
unproblematic for the LHWs.


**Close relationships and the need for boundaries**


In several studies, LHWs and health professionals working
alongside them described how the closeness of the LHW-recipient
relationship and the magnitude of recipients’ problems could be
emotionally draining, create confidentiality problems, and prevent
the LHWs from doing their jobs properly (Daniels 2010; Heaman
2006; Lancman 2009; Malema 2010; Meier 2007;Perkins 2001;
Woodgate 2007). LHWs also struggled to deal with disagreements
between them and their clients (Korfmacher 2002). LHWs and
their supervisors saw the need to draw clear boundaries and
to disassociate recipients’ emotional needs from the LHWs’ own
personal lives (Daniels 2010; Heaman 2006; Lancman 2009; Low
2006b; Meier 2007; Woodgate 2007). However, as respondents
in one study pointed out, drawing boundaries could be more
challenging for a LHW than for a health professional as LHW tasks
were ofen day-to-day activities and less likely to be perceived as
professional tasks by recipients (Heaman 2006). These concerns
were generally not voiced by recipients. However, in one USbased study recipients did worry that LHWs making home visits
might observe and possibly report sensitive information, for
instance about maternal depression or abuse (Sheppard 2004),
while in another US-based study teen mothers feared a lack of
confidentiality and complained that LHWs would share stories with
each other about their clients (Korfmacher 2002). In one South
African study women feared that being visited by a breastfeeding
counsellor might lead other community members to think they
were HIV-positive (Daniels 2010).


**Safety concerns**


In some communities, particularly in urban settings, povertyrelated and social problems such as violence and drug abuse
were commonplace (Daniels 2010; Lancman 2009; Perkins
2001;Woodgate 2007). LHWs sometimes found themselves in
dangerous situations, both in people’s homes and in the
neighbourhood, ofen with little or no means of assistance
and no access to a telephone (Daniels 2010; Lancman 2009;
Woodgate 2007). In Zambia, trained traditional birth attendants
were reluctant to visit clients at night because of safety issues
(Ngoma 2009). Safe transport was one of the measures called
for to minimize risk (Daniels 2010; Ngoma 2009). In South Africa,
LHWs sometimes asked people to accompany them for fear of
attack (Daniels 2010); while in Brazil, LHWs developed a number
of strategies to protect themselves, making use of community
networks to exchange information about the area (Lancman 2009).
In this study LHWs and other members of the health worker team
“felt offended concerning their own integrity, because they had to
remain silent in the face of situations of domestic violence or even
disrespect for others” (Lancman 2009).

**Restrictions on women’s movements**


In two studies from Bangladesh, sociocultural norms restricting
the movement of women led to some LHWs being reluctant to
go on household visits. LHWs who did so were sometimes met
with disapproval from family members, religious leaders, and other
elders in the village (Khan 1998; Rashid 2001).


**Burden of responsibility**


One study from Kenya suggested that LHWs that lived in the same
community as programme recipients may be more vulnerable to
blame than other healthcare workers (Kaler 2001), “When things
are good, a provider is very important [in the village], but when
things go wrong, it is “an agent who brought [trouble] ...” (Kaler
2001).


**Lack of knowledge, user fees, or concerns about interventions could**
**lead to low utilization by recipients**


Although recipients in most of the studies indicated a high level
of acceptability with the LHW programmes, some studies also
described less positive attitudes. In some studies the target groups
had poor knowledge of the LHW programme itself or were not
fully aware of the services that the programme could offer (Bisika
2008; Kaufmann 1997; Mathews 1994; Murphy 2008; Wayland
2002). In one study recipients were aware of the existence of
trained traditional birth attendants but were mostly unable to
utilize them because they could not afford their services (Ngoma
2009). In other studies, target groups apparently underutilized
programme interventions because of a lack of understanding of
intervention benefits (Low 2006) or because of concerns about
intervention safety (Mathole 2005; Simmons 1990). For instance,
recipients sometimes associated major suffering with the use of
contraceptives (Kaler 2001; Simmons 1990), or an increased risk of
having to undergo caesarean section if LHWs referred them to a
health facility (Mathole 2005). These concerns were also sometimes
shared by the LHW (Kaler 2001; Mathole 2005).


**Lack of programme appropriateness could lead to low acceptability**


**Relevance of LHW services**


Some studies pointed to a low use of LHW services when
these services failed to meet the perceived needs of community
members (Mathews 1994; Murphy 2008; Wayland 2002). LHWs
were sometimes confronted with non-healthcare related problems
such as housing, food insecurity, and social and domestic
violence (Lancman 2009; Meier 2007); and, in some cases, the
poverty-related and social problems recipients faced in their
everyday lives were experienced as more pressing than the
issues that the LHW programmes aimed to address (Meier
2007;Wayland 2002). In one study from Brazil, this led to
an almost complete failure of the programme. Here, LHW
tasks included assessing children’s nutritional status, enrolling
malnourished children into a milk programme, and spreading
information about nutrition, immunisation, hygiene, respiratory
infections, breastfeeding and prenatal care. According to study
authors, programme administrators “[assumed that] once people
learn how to correctly manage their environment and care for
their children, health will improve” (Wayland 2002). Community
members disagreed with this assumption, arguing that they knew
how to care for their children but that their income and living
conditions prevented them from doing so. While they accepted
those services they perceived to be of use, such as enrolment



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


in the milk programme, they regarded most of the services on
offer as ineffectual, patronising and intrusive. As a result, many
LHWs, who received a 'less than warm welcome during home visits'
became frustrated and eventually stopped performing their duties
(Wayland 2002).


**Adequacy of LHW services**


In other programmes, services may have been relevant but were not
always sufficient. Recipients’ poor access to other health services,
particularly in the studies from low and middle income countries,
meant that LHWs were ofen approached about issues outside
the scope of their training. Recipients asked about issues such as
mental health, malaria, HIV/AIDS and emerging diseases (Alcock
2009; Haq 2009); and requested treatment for minor childhood
diseases such as scabies, worms or eye infections, women’s health
complaints, and other complaints (Kaufmann 1997; Mkandawire
2005; Simmons 1990). LHWs were also asked to help recipients
to access other services (Meier 2007) and accompany them to
health facilities (Simmons 1990), which was a task that may
have been particularly important in situations where clients had
strained relationships with health professionals or where cultural
constraints discouraged women from travelling unaccompanied.


LHWs in a programme in India were given more training to
cover some of these additional health topics (Siu 2009), while
in a Nicaraguan programme the role of the LHW was extended
to include curative health care, leading to an increase in LHW
motivation and community respect and satisfaction (George
2009). However, many LHWs, particularly those providing only
promotional and preventive healthcare, were unable to meet these
additional requests (Kaufmann 1997; Mkandawire 2005; Simmons
1990). In addition, programme priorities meant that LHWs did not
always have the time or the transport to accompany women to
healthcare facilities (Simmons 1990).


**Irrelevant or insufficient services and feelings of impotence**


An inability to respond to the expressed needs of the community
led to feelings of frustration and impotence (Daniels 2010; Lancman
2009; Mkandawire 2005; Wayland 2002). While some LHWs wanted
to be able to offer more information (Haq 2009), others wanted
to provide what was referred to as 'real health care' such as
medicines and immunisations (Mkandawire 2005;Wayland 2002)
and to be trained as paramedical personnel (Kaler 2001). In
studies in Iran and South Africa (Javanparast 2009; Mathews 1994),
LHWs and others also called for more LHW involvement or more
community involvement in programme planning: “In this way, the
help can be organised and spent in the best way to meet people’s
needs” (Javanparast 2009). However, the opportunity to offer 'real
health care' could also represent a 'double-edged sword' as it could
also leave the LHW vulnerable to blame if things went wrong (Kaler
2001).


**Lay health worker (LHW) credibility, appropriateness and acceptance**
**influenced by collaboration with other stakeholders**


**Visible ties to the health system**


Recipients expressed confidence in the knowledge and skills of
the LHWs and saw them as a useful source of information (Bisika
2008; Chinbuah 2006; Daniels 2010; George 2009;Hazard 2009;
Hendrickson 2002; Islam 2001; Javanparast 2009; Mathews 1994;
Sheppard 2004; Warrick 1992). Several studies, particularly those
from low and middle income countries, described how LHW

credibility in the community was strengthened by their connection
with the formal health system. Here, knowledge that the LHWs were
trained and supervised through the formal health system, and had
good access to the health system, helped to strengthen community
trust in the programme (Alcock 2009; Ashwell 2009; Daniels 2010;
Hinojosa 2004;Kaler 2001). Conversely, a lack of visible support
from the health system could weaken LHW credibility (Ashwell
2009; Low 2006; Rashid 2001).


Both LHWs and community members described how LHW
credibility was enhanced through visible symbols of their
connection to the health system, for instance through their use of
safe delivery kits, signboards, uniforms, and educational picture
cards (Alcock 2009; Glenton 2010; Islam 2001; Kaler 2001). Visits
from supervisors, visible contact with health professionals, making
referrals to clinics, and accompanying programme recipients to
these clinics also served to emphasise the LHWs’ ties to and
recognition by the health services (Ashwell 2009; Kaler 2001;
Nankunda 2006). LHWs also believed that their credibility had been
enhanced through messages in the media, arguing that people
believed in the information they provided when it was repeated on
television (Haq 2009).


While strong ties to the health system appeared to enhance
LHW credibility, many community members also had negative
attitudes towards and experiences of health professionals. In at
least one study LHWs feared that too strong an association with
health professionals could damage their credibility, and wished to
disassociate themselves from some of the more negative aspects,
for instance by emphasising that they were unpaid (Glenton 2010).
In another study the credibility of peer counsellors was questioned
by mothers who asked if they were being paid to visit them and
they “did not want to be used in what they suspected was the peer
supporters’ process of enriching themselves” (Daniels 2010).


**Community leader support**


Some studies, all based in low and middle income countries,
suggested that LHW programme credibility and acceptability, as
well as necessary community mobilization, could be enhanced
through the active support by and participation of community
leaders (Ashwell 2009; Dynes 2011; Mekonnen 2008). This support
could be encouraged through community leaders’ involvement
in programme training (Ashwell 2009); community leaders’
participation in programme activities (Dynes 2011), their exposure
to successful examples of similar programmes (Ashwell 2009), and
LHWs’ participation in community leadership meetings, including
local village health committees (Bisika 2008). However, the success
of this type of involvement was said to be primarily useful where
local leaders had authority and respect and were dynamic and
responsive to community needs (Ashwell 2009; McQuestion 2010),
and less successful in communities where leadership was weak and
where communities lacked strong social and political organisation
(Ashwell 2009; Dynes 2011). In addition, LHWs sometimes found it
challenging to establish or participate in these types of meetings
(Haq 2009).


**Choice of target group**


Respondents in some studies pointed to the importance of support
and participation from other family members, including motherin-laws, but particularly husbands and partners, for programme
success (Ashwell 2009; Daniels 2010; Dynes 2011; Haq 2009;
Mekonnen 2008; Nankunda 2006; Raine 2003; Rashid 2001;



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


Warrick 1992). Some concern was expressed over the lack of
male involvement (Dynes 2011), and LHWs and programme staff
suggested that education programmes and campaigns should
more actively target men (Bisika 2008), for instance through maleonly meetings (Dynes 2011) and through adding male characters
to mass media campaigns (Haq 2009). The inclusion of men
was not without its challenges, however. In one study, MexicanAmerican LHWs ran prenatal care classes that were attended by
both women and their spouses or boyfriends. “Initially, women
had difficulty adjusting to the presence of men in the classes,
especially spouses or boyfriends of other women, and they were
hesitant to speak out. Their embarrassment was shared by some of
the promotoras who had difficulty, with males present, broaching
intimate topics such as birth control or showing the birthing
film” (Warrick 1992). In Pakistan, LHWs found it difficult to talk to
men about family planning, and felt that their communication skills
could be improved (Haq 2009). In South Africa, LHWs called for
training in counselling of couples for HIV/AIDs (Malema 2010).


_**Programme acceptability, appropriateness and credibility: the**_
_**lay health worker (LHW)-health professional relationship**_


**Different experiences with the lay health worker (LHW)-health**
**professional relationship**


**Health professionals' appreciation ofLHW contribution**


Relationships between LHWs and health professionals were
experienced differently across groups, within programmes, and
across programmes. In one study, LHWs defined a good LHW-health
professional relationship as one that was characterised by support,
mutual respect, trust and partnership (Heaman 2006). In some
programmes, LHWs generally felt respected and supported by the
health professionals with whom they collaborated (George 2009;
Heaman 2006; Malema 2010). However, professional acceptance
of LHWs was described as being a gradual process (George 2009;
Raine 2003). In at least two programmes (George 2009; Smith 2007)
health professionals were initially negative to the LHWs but had
changed their attitudes with a growing acknowledgement of the
positive impact the LHWs could have on the health services and on
people’s health. Health professionals in several studies emphasised
the LHWs’ valuable contribution to their busy workload (Curtis
2007; George 2009; Hazard 2009; Raine 2003; Smith 2007). Some
described the LHWs as key to the success of the programme
(Heaman 2006), admiring their skills in communicating with the
target population and their knowledge and experience of the issues
at hand (George 2009; Hazard 2009;Heaman 2006; Raine 2003; Siu
2009). Some health professionals believed that these skills could
lead to better access to the target population (Siu 2009), more
culturally appropriate care (Hazard 2009), and greater community
mobilisation (George 2009). LHWs were also respected for their
commitment and dedication to their patients and the community
(Dynes 2011;Hazard 2009). In one study, health professionals
suggested that the collaboration with LHWs had changed the way
they themselves perceived and worked with their clients (Curtis
2007), while a health professional in another study described LHWs
as lending her 'street credibility' by association (Raine 2003).


**LHWs, health professionals, and equality**


But while health professionals in one study described the LHWs
as “like friends, co-workers, very much part of the team” (Hazard
2009), authors of another study suggested that “there was
little evidence to suggest that health professionals regarded

the volunteers as colleagues with whom they might establish
relationships of trust and equality” (Curtis 2007). In other studies
the relationship was “recognised by all as unequal and that the
lay health worker was subservient” (Mathews 1994), LHWs felt
“way at the bottom of the totem pole” (Heaman 2006), and
some LHWs believed that health professionals looked down upon
them (Malema 2010). In one study LHW responses indicated that
programme staff had made few efforts to make the LHWls feel
as if they were part of the organisation (Siu 2009). In at least
three studies trained traditional birth attendants complained of
arrogance and lack of respect from health professionals (Hinojosa
2004; Low 2006; Mathole 2005).


**Factors influencing the health professional–LHW relationship**


The studies suggested a number of factors that may have
threatened the development of good working relationships
between LHWs and health professionals. Nurses in one programme
pointed out that they were expected to function simultaneously
as partners, supervisors and evaluators, and some found these
roles conflicting. In another programme, health professionals
complained that the programme had added to their workload
(Woodgate 2007). In other programmes (Beake 2005; Curtis 2007;
Heaman 2006), health professionals emphasised the importance of
maintaining boundaries between their roles and the roles of the
LHWs. Overstepping these boundaries could be viewed negatively
and health professional narratives in one study suggested a fear
that they would lose some of their own authority if LHWs were given
more authority (Curtis 2007).


Some studies suggested that the closer the collaboration was
between the health professional and the LHW, the better the
relationship was likely to be. In three programmes, health
professionals who worked closely with LHWs appeared to have
a more respectful or equal relationship with them than those
working at a greater distance (Ashwell 2009; Curtis 2007;Mathews
1994). In one of these programmes, good relationships were
observed to be stronger where local health professionals had been
actively involved in training LHWs than where they had not been
involved (Ashwell 2009).


_**Lay health worker (LHW) motivation and incentives**_


**Lay health workers (LHWs) ofen driven by several, intertwined**
**motives**


Respondents had a number of ofen intertwined motives for
working as LHWs, both intrinsic and extrinsic.


**Altruism**


Altruistic motives were expressed by LHWs in many of the studies.
LHWs described how they felt good about helping others (Curtis
2007; Hazard 2009; Low 2006b; Meier 2007) and wanted to
contribute to and serve the community (Behnke 2002; Bettiol 2004;
Downie 2004; Hendrickson 2002; Javanparast 2009; Khan 1998;
Malema 2010). Some referred to religious or moral callings or
convictions (Glenton 2010; Low 2006; Maupin 2008; Mkandawire
2005).


**Gain of knowledge and skills**


LHWs also sought out and took pride in the knowledge and skills
they gained (Bettiol 2004; Downie 2004; Glenton 2010; Warrick
1992), stating that this knowledge could be advantageous not only



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


to recipients but also to themselves and their families (Hendrickson
2002; Khan 1998; Nankunda 2006).


**Social recognition**


LHWs were also motivated by the respect they received from
programme recipients (Curtis 2007; George 2009; Malema 2010)
and an increased social status in their own homes and in the
community (Alcock 2009; Glenton 2010; Nankunda 2006; Rashid
2001), particularly in low and middle income countries. LHWs
believed that social recognition was a result of their being trained
(George 2009), their ability to treat illnesses (Khan 1998; Rashid
2001), their moral standing as unpaid volunteers and good hearted
people (Glenton 2010; Kaler 2001), and their social importance
(Kaler 2001). In one Uganda-based study, some of the LHWs stated
that their role had helped them gain an identity and an image which
were important for their political engagement (Siu 2009).


**Empowerment**


LHWs’ acquisition of knowledge and skills, their increased social
status, participation in a process that was valued by others, and
experiences of success in achieving programme goals ofen led to
feelings of empowerment, increased confidence and self-esteem
(Alcock 2009; Ashwell 2009; Behnke 2002; Curtis 2007; Downie
2004; Hendrickson 2002; Nankunda 2006;Raine 2003; Sibley 2006;
Warrick 1992). Authors of one UK-based study commented that
“For women living in disadvantaged areas, whose opportunities
for self-advancement are few, [the value of] this type of outcome
should not be underestimated” (Raine 2003). Some LHWs described
how this new self-perception had led to changes in their behaviour
both within the programme and in other areas of their lives. LHWs
experienced greater assertiveness, for instance with authority
figures (Curtis 2007), greater autonomy in decision making (Alcock
2009), greater confidence in their ability to deliver existing tasks
(Daniels 2010), confidence enough to request additional training
in new areas (Warrick 1992), and greater confidence in taking care
of their own families and participating in community activities
(Hendrickson 2002).


**Possibility of future employment**


Some LHWs hoped their jobs would lead to further education or
future employment (Curtis 2007; Low 2006b; Meier 2007; Nankunda
2006; Siu 2009).


**Social life**


Some LHWs also referred to the social benefits of the work, such as
the opportunity to get out of the house and meet new people (Curtis
2007; Downie 2004; Glenton 2010).


**Shared goals**


One Mexican study described how LHWs’ decision to join a
programme was influenced by the extent to which they were able
to align their own world view with that of the programme (RamirezValles 2003).


**Monetary and non-monetary incentives ofen important but not**
**unproblematic**


In addition to the sources of motivation mentioned above, LHWs
also received different types of formal incentives through the
programmes.

**Regular salaries**



**Trusted evidence.**
**Informed decisions.**
**Better health.**



Most of the LHWs in high income countries received regular
payment, but the situation was far more mixed among LHWs
in low and middle income countries. Unsalaried LHWs in some
programmes expressed a strong desire for regular payment (Kaler
2001; Nankunda 2006) and were distressed by the fact they were
not permanently employed (Malema 2010). In other programmes,
salaried LHWs were dissatisfied with their wages (Daniels 2010;
Meier 2007; Smith 2007; Woodgate 2007), believing that the
wage did not reflect their abilities (Woodgate 2007), their level
of responsibility (Smith 2007), or their increase in skills as they
acquired further training and education (Meier 2007). In some
programmes, LHWs and other stakeholder groups argued that
LHWs were likely to drop out if other, better paid jobs were available
to them (Daniels 2010; Glenton 2010; Khan 1998).


Policy makers in one study from Nepal regarded LHW salaries as
financially unsustainable (Glenton 2010). One person pointed out
that as the entire health system employed 23,000 staff, the financial
impact of hiring the 48,000 LHWs working for the programme would
be enormous. They emphasised the need for consistency over time,
urging donors and others to avoid starting anything that could
not be sustained, but suspecting international organisations used
payment to achieve the short-term results they needed regardless
of whether this was sustainable in the long term (Glenton 2010).
In the same study, programme managers, policy makers and the
LHWs themselves were sceptical with respect to the introduction of
regular payment as they feared that this might threaten the LHWs’
social status (Glenton 2010). This scepticism was expressed in a
context where the LHW’s social status was closely tied to her moral
standing as an unpaid volunteer, and where widespread negative
attitudes existed towards the moral status of paid health workers
and other government employees. LHWs and policy makers in
this study agreed on a number of conditions that made this lack
of payment acceptable, including the LHWs’ freedom to deliver
services when and if they wanted. The introduction of tasks not in
line with these conditions were considered differently, and LHWs
expected some form of compensation for such tasks.


The issue of being paid to work in one's own community also
caused some problems in a South African study. Here, mothers
were concerned that peer counsellors were using home visits as a
means to gaining a personal income and they “did not want to be
used in what they suspected was the peer supporters’ process of
enriching themselves” (Daniels 2010). In Australia, volunteer LHWs
felt that payment would change the dynamics of the friendship
between them and the mothers they visited, while the mothers
themselves appreciated the volunteers because they visited them
out of free will (Taggart 2000).


**Monetary incentives**


In many of the studies where LHWs were not paid, other types
of monetary incentives were ofen given and were appreciated.
These included lunch money (Kaler 2001), facilitation allowances
(Siu 2009), health insurance and educational stipends (Meier 2007).
These types of incentives ofen aimed to ensure that LHWs did
not have out-of-pocket expenses. In one programme in Thailand,
however, unsalaried LHWs were required to attend continuing
education classes without remuneration for transportation costs,
causing dissatisfaction (Kaufmann 1997).



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


**Non-monetary incentives**


Formal non-monetary incentives included bicycles (Nankunda
2006), uniforms (Glenton 2010; Kaler 2001; Nankunda 2006), 'tool
boxes', bags, signboards (Alcock 2009; Glenton 2010;Kaler 2001)
and promotional material such as T-shirts (Siu 2009). While these
incentives were primarily meant to help the LHWs perform their
tasks more efficiently, they also appeared to motivate LHWs,
for instance by increasing their visibility and social recognition
(Glenton 2010; Kaler 2001; Nankunda 2006). However, lack of the
tools necessary to perform their work could also lead to frustration
and demotivation (Rashid 2001).


**User fees**


In some programmes LHWs were paid, at least in part, through
the profit they earned from selling drugs and supplements. In one
programme, in Bangladesh, high dropout rates among LHWs were
partly blamed on programme staff giving the LHWs an inflated idea
of the profit they would be making (Khan 1998). Other problems
included people buying medicine on credit. While community
members saw this as an advantage (Rashid 2001), LHWs in at
least one study found it difficult to collect the money aferwards
(Khan 1998). In this same study people were also reluctant to buy
medicine because of their perception that the programme got the
medicine free (Khan 1998). In Kenya, LHWs sold iron supplements
to members of the community but encountered a number of
problems, including competition from untrained vendors of the
same supplements, negatively affecting their motivation (Suchdev
2010).


**Community-based payment**


The possibility of financing LHW incentives or other parts of the
programme through community-based systems was discussed in
two studies, in Gambia and Malawi. In both studies communities
preferred that incentives were provided by others, for instance
governments or NGOs (Chinbuah 2006; Mkandawire 2005). In
Malawi, this reluctance to support the programme financially was
attributed to experiences with forced financial support to political
parties and a desire to move away from this kind of community
support (Mkandawire 2005).


**Performance-based incentives**


In one study, policy makers and programme managers were
sceptical of the performance-based incentives sometimes adopted
by international donor organisations, referring to experiences of
over-reporting of tasks among other cadres (Glenton 2010).


**Differences in payment**


In two programmes LHWs referred to frustration when payment
differed from region to region or across different types of
institutions (Glenton 2010; Mekonnen 2008).


**How could lay health workers (LHWs) influence which incentives they**
**receive?**


Few of the studies discussed how LHWs could voice their demands
regarding payment and other incentives. In Iran, LHWs complained
that there was nobody to hear their voice and no place to complain
(Javanparast 2009). In Nepal, policy makers pointed out that LHWs
could voice their opinions through the Village Health Committee,
where they had a seat, at least in those areas where these
committees were functioning (Glenton 2010). However, collective

rather than individual demands were more difficult to make. While
such demands had been made by LHW associations in Nepal, the
representativity of these associations was questioned, and policy
makers, programme managers and LHW representatives pointed to
social, financial and topographical constraints that made it difficult
for LHWs to establish representative bodies (Glenton 2010).


_**Lay health worker (LHW) training, supervision and working**_
_**conditions**_


**Wide variations in the perceived quality of training**


Adequate training was regarded as key to the effective and safe
delivery of healthcare interventions, but satisfaction with training
varied within and across studies. LHWs in several studies were
happy with the knowledge gained and found the training very
useful (bij de Vaate 2002; Meier 2007; Nankunda 2006). Aspects
of training that were highlighted as positive included the use
of practical demonstrations, picture cards, frequent refresher
training, and training in recent knowledge (bij de Vaate 2002;
Malema 2010; Sibley 2006).


Several studies pointed to LHW training as an area that needed
to be addressed, and highlighted a number of weaknesses with
current practice (Low 2006b; Malema 2010; Meier 2007;Rashid
2001; Simmons 1990; Smith 2007; Woodgate 2007). Some studies
pointed out that training schedules were not always flexible
enough to respond to turnover and the recruitment of new LHWs,
leaving them untrained or inactive for shorter or longer periods
(Rashid 2001; Woodgate 2007). Some study authors and some
LHWs questioned the quality of the actual training, including the
competence of the trainers and the degree to which it gave LHWs
the necessary skills to perform their tasks (Daniels 2010; Malema
2010; Meier 2007; Simmons 1990; Smith 2007; Woodgate 2007).


**Lay health workers (LHWs) called for training in counselling and**
**communication skills**


LHWs particularly emphasised the importance of training in
health promotion and counselling. While LHWs in at least one
study felt that training had been adequate for this task (Siu
2009), communicating with community members about different
healthcare issues was seen as a complex task (Alcock 2009), and
LHWs in several other studies felt unprepared (Haq 2009;Malema
2010; Meier 2007; Mekonnen 2008). In one study LHWs struggled
to find a balance between giving information and giving advice,
particularly as the giving of advice also brought with it the burden of
responsibility in the case of problems (Nankunda 2006). In another
study the authors pointed out that the trainers themselves had no
specific qualifications in health education (Siu 2009).


**Learning communication skills**


When learning communication skills, LHWs in one study found that
following an experienced LHW as she interacted with participants
was particularly helpful (Meier 2007). In another study the LHWs
identified and discussed cultural beliefs that community members
might have and that might represent obstacles to the intervention,
and were therefore better prepared when communicating about
the intervention (Nankunda 2006).


**Tools and techniques for communication**


When communicating with community members, other studies
noted that a number of tools and techniques had been particularly
helpful. These included the use of visual tools, such as picture



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


cards and flipcharts, videos, and dolls (Alcock 2009; Ashwell 2009;
Dynes 2011; George 2009; Meier 2007). Mass media campaigns
repeating the messages that LHWs gave were also seen as
useful (Haq 2009). Explanations, personal follow-up and materials
designed for people of low literacy were referred to as particularly
helpful in improving recipient understanding (George 2009). In
Ethiopia, LHWs used a variety of venues and opportunities to
spread information to community members, including “community
meetings, coffee ceremony, woman’s association weekly meetings,
antenatal and immunization outreach sessions, when fetching
water or firewood, and even during labor” (Sibley 2006).


**Lay health workers (LHWs) called for more training in tasks outside**
**their current scope**


In addition to more training in counselling skills, LHWs in some
studies wanted training in topics outside the scope of their role
(Kaufmann 1997; Low 2006; Low 2006b; Warrick 1992). In one study
(Kaufmann 1997) LHWs wanted more information about common
health problems that their work brought them into contact with,
while in another study (Low 2006b) they called for training in how
to deal with sexual abuse, substance abuse, domestic violence,
and housing difficulties. In another study trained trained birth
attendants felt confident in their ability to deal with a normal
birth but were concerned about their lack of knowledge in dealing
with complications and wanted additional training (Low 2006). In a
fourth study the increased confidence that training and repetition
gave led to requests for additional training in new areas (Warrick
1992).


**Training did not always reflect the local context**


In one Zimbabwean study, the authors suggested that problems
with compliance among trained traditional birth attendants
could be tied to the way training was conducted (Mathole
2005). The authors argue that “the training made little effort
to integrate into the health care system the elements for which
TBA care continues to appeal to women”, including a common
understanding between traditional birth attendants and recipients
regarding the spiritual and supernatural aspects of pregnancy
(Mathole 2005). In Guatemala, the authors suggested that the
emphasis on theoretical knowledge at the expense of experiential
knowledge reflected in the contents of the training, the manner in
which training was carried out, and the background of the trainers
may limit midwives’ acceptance of the training material (Maupin
2008).


**Supervision was seen as important but was ofen neglected**


For programme staff, supervision was an opportunity to assess and
strengthen the knowledge and skills of the LHW and the quality of
intervention delivery (Daniels 2010). Some supervisors highlighted
the importance of 'non-technical' aspects of supervision, including
emotional support to LHWs and help in setting boundaries, as well
as motivating LHWs and building up the esteem of women who
may never previously have worked outside of their own homes
(Daniels 2010). For the LHWs themselves, supervision was seen as
a way of achieving support and guidance and addressing ongoing
challenges and as a mechanism for continued training (Dynes 2011;
George 2009; Heaman 2006; Nankunda 2006). Visible supervision
could also increase LHW credibility in the community (Nankunda
2006). Despite widespread acknowledgement of the importance of
supervision, satisfaction with current practice varied (Meier 2007)
and the studies showed definite room for improvement (Bisika

2008; Chinbuah 2006; Dynes 2011; Mathole 2005; Rashid 2001;
Smith 2007).


**Field supervision**


Supervisory field visits were highlighted as important as a lack
of such visits meant that supervisors could not properly assess
the work of the LHWs (Daniels 2010; George 2009) and they were
sometimes unfamiliar with the conditions under which the LHWs
worked and the problems of the community (Wayland 2002). A
number of reasons were offered for lack of supervision, including
supervisors’ lack of time (George 2009), too much time spent on
routine paperwork and reporting (Simmons 1990), responsibility
for large districts (Bisika 2008), lack of transportation (George 2009;
Simmons 1990), and gender roles making it difficult for female
supervisors to move around in a large field area (Simmons 1990).


**Supervision and skills**


Health professionals did not always feel prepared for their role
as supervisors (Woodgate 2007). In one study, LHWs appreciated
the manner in which supervisors talked to them, without
reprimanding them, while the supervisors themselves emphasised
the importance of working alongside the LHWs as a team (George
2009). In another study, however, nurses expressed varying levels
of comfort with the dual role of partners and supervisors or
evaluators. In a third study the supervisors pointed out that while
they were in charge, they also needed to balance this position
of authority with the respect they were expected to display to
LHWs who were their elders (Daniels 2010). In the same study
the supervisors also emphasised the importance of understanding
the LHWs’ circumstances, particularly their HIV status, in order
to be able to support them sufficiently. In a fourth study some
supervisors needed to be taught how to first observe the LHWs and
then correct them at the end of the observation rather than take
over their tasks (Nankunda 2006).


**Peer support**


LHWs in some studies wanted the opportunity to meet regularly
with other LHWs in order to share experiences and give each other
support (Low 2006b; Taggart 2000).


**Working conditions were ofen associated with challenges**


**Workload**


LHWs and supervisors in several studies expressed concern about
the LHWs’ workload and the distances they had to cover (Dynes
2011; Javanparast 2009; Kaufmann 1997; Mekonnen 2008; Murphy
2008; Nankunda 2006; Simmons 1990; Wayland 2002). In one
study from Bangladesh, many women received no visits from the
LHWs, while those who did ofen received no services: “These are
instances where the worker’s sole interest is to sign the household
visitation card kept in the client’s house, in order to convey to her
supervisor the impression of regular visits” (Simmons 1990). The
study authors saw the LHWs’ unrealistic workloads as a main cause
of these problems (Simmons 1990).


**Poor facilities**


In two studies trained traditional birth attendants complained of
poor working conditions, including inadequate lighting and small
and dirty rooms (Bisika 2008; Hinojosa 2004), while LHWs in one
study asked for more space and additional benches or mats in their
clinics so that they could organise meetings (Dynes 2011).



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


**High turnover**


In two studies high turnover of LHWs was described as a problem
for the running of the programme (Khan 1998; Woodgate 2007).


**Lack of supplies**


In some studies a lack of supplies, including medicines, and a lack
of equipment such as timers to count breathing and flipcharts were
a source of frustration among LHWs and some recipients (Low 2006;
McQuestion 2010; Rashid 2001; Simmons 1990; Suchdev 2010).


In Bangladesh, LHWs were unable to distribute iron for anaemia
because there was no provision for field distribution of iron tablets
or any other medical supplies in the government programme
(Simmons 1990). These LHWs were also supposed to distribute oral
rehydration solution. However, “pervasive service rivalries” had led
to a lack of co-ordination between the department responsible
for oral rehydration solution distribution and the department
responsible for the LHW programme, leaving these LHWs without
supplies (Low 2006).


**Bureaucracy**


In one study (Javanparast 2009) LHWs complained about the
amount of paperwork required of them, while supervisors in
another study were also hampered by the amount of routine
paperwork and report writing (Simmons 1990). At the same time,
the absence of a client-oriented record-seeking system was seen to
hamper these tasks (Simmons 1990).


_**Patient flow processes**_


**Several obstacles prevented lay health workers (LHWs) from referring**
**clients on**


In eight studies traditional birth attendants (TBAs) were trained to
recognise danger signs in pregnant women or women giving birth
and to refer these women on to health professionals (bij de Vaate
2002; Bisika 2008; Hinojosa 2004; Islam 2001; Low 2006; Mathole
2005; Maupin 2008; Ngoma 2009; Sibley 2006). Compliance was
not always high, however, and health centre staff in one study
were concerned that trained TBAs were overconfident about their
ability to manage certain danger signs on their own or lacked the
knowledge to recognise such signs. However, the studies suggested
that lack of TBA knowledge about danger signs was not the
main barrier to referrals (Bisika 2008; Hinojosa 2004; Low 2006;
Mathole 2005). Instead, a number of other obstacles were pointed
to including a lack of health professionals to refer patients to, lack of
transport, compliance factors among the women themselves, and
poor relationships between trained TBAs and health professionals.


**Lack of health professionals**


While TBAs were trained to refer problematic pregnancies or births
on, short-staffing at the clinic was reported as a problem by trained
TBAs and community members (Islam 2001; Low 2006).


**Poor compliance** _**, and a**_ **ttitudes and fears in the community**


In a Gambian study, trained TBAs reported that women did not
complain about being referred to the hospital (bij de Vaate 2002).
According to the TBAs, mothers accepted their decisions as they
trusted the trained TBAs, because women who were referred came
back safely with their babies, and because relatives agreed that
it was necessary to refer on (bij de Vaate 2002). In a Zambian
study, on the other hand, many families did not use the services

of the trained TBAs at all because they could not afford to pay
them, and they were also concerned that the TBAs would refer
them on, which would lead to more costs, for instance for transport
and additional healthcare services Ngoma 2009). Trained TBAs in
Malawi and Honduras complained that pregnant women and their
relatives were ofen ignorant of the need for referral (Bisika 2008),
or reluctant to be referred to hospitals or health centres (Low 2006).
This reluctance was apparently tied to perceptions of clinic staff as
arrogant and rude as well as a fear of caesarean section, a fear that
was also shared by TBAs (Mathole 2005). Trained TBAs reported
that women avoided going to the clinic by contacting the TBA too
late for referral to be an option (Bisika 2008; Low 2006; Mathole
2005). In these situations TBAs felt obliged to deal with cases
they would normally refer on but described the tension between
ignoring their training and risking blame from the health centre
staff if anything went wrong and ignoring the needs of the woman
and risking blame from the woman’s family (Bisika 2008; Low 2006;
Mathole 2005): “So what do you do? You cannot run away from a
woman and leave her groaning, you just have to assist” (Mathole
2005).


**Poor relationship between trained TBAs and health professionals**


In addition to the women’s misgivings, trained TBAs themselves
were sometimes reluctant to refer women on because of the
treatment they received by health professionals. They described
varied experiences when arriving at the health centre, including
having to wait for long periods of time (Low 2006) and being treated
with arrogance and lack of respect, which discouraged them from
accompanying women to the clinic (Mathole 2005). Trained TBAs in
another study reported that when they escorted a woman in labour
to hospital, the midwives sent them out of the hospital, leaving
them with no place to sleep (bij de Vaate 2002). A climate of mistrust
and competition between the trained TBAs and the clinic staff was
also referred to by the TBAs as a reason for not referring (Mathole
2005).


One study described particularly serious problems tied to health
professionals’ attitudes towards TBA referral (Hinojosa 2004). In
this Guatemala-based study, trained TBAs ofen spent much energy
trying to identify a physician who would assist women with
complicated pregnancy or labour. Some physicians refused to carry
out what they referred to as the repair work of the TBAs, and
would only attend women who had been under their control for
the entire pregnancy. The physicians were not only concerned
about the outcomes of the cases but were concerned about their
prestigio, or public prestige and reputation, and did not want to be
blamed for an infant or maternal death (Hinojosa 2004). The study
pointed out that this selectiveness of clients was also seen among
the trained TBAs, although to a lesser extent. Here and in another
Guatemalan study (Maupin 2008), trained TBAs were reluctant to
take on pregnant women who may have been at higher risk and
were quick to refer on. The authors suggested that this was a result
of the authorities’ tacit and overt encouragement of the TBAs to
question their own diagnostic and management abilities (Hinojosa
2004), and of a change in the social status and authority of the
traditional midwife (Maupin 2008).


**Logistical factors**


Other obstacles to referral included logistical factors, particularly
the lack of transport necessary to move the woman to the clinic,
and also lack of money to pay for transport, or a telephone with



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


which to call an ambulance (Bettiol 2004; bij de Vaate 2002; Bisika
2008; Low 2006: Mathole 2005; Maupin 2008).


**Other obstacles to trained TBA referral**


In one study trained TBAs reported that some women delivered on
their own, and TBAs therefore had no opportunity to refer them on
(bij de Vaate 2002). In another study women sometimes travelled
outside of their district to visit particular TBAs that had been
recommended to them, making referral systems difficult (Mathole
2005).


**Referral by LHWs other than trained TBAs**


Studies of LHWs other than trained TBAs showed varying
experiences with referral. In Nicaragua (George 2009) and
Kenya (Kaler 2001), patients accompanied by LHWs were given
preferential treatment by clinic staff. In South Africa, LHWs reported
that NGO health services were usually far more responsive to
referral than any of the government health services (Mathews
1994).


The issue of referral and possible overconfidence was also
discussed in some of the studies of other types of LHWs. Low
compliance was a matter of concern in at least one study where
Gambian LHWs were trained to diagnose, treat and refer children
with malaria (Chinbuah 2006). Although not instructed to do so,
LHWs performed follow-up visits to many of the children they had
treated to review the condition of the child. These visits were
partially explained by the study authors as a sign of overconfidence.
However, the LHWs themselves mentioned that “ofen they were
uncertain and thus preferred to follow up to determine the child’s
condition rather than refer immediately. They insisted that even
when referred, most caregivers would not go to the health facility
citing lack of funds as a reason” (Chinbuah 2006).


In one UK-based study, authors also described how established
and confident LHWs made decisions without consulting their
supervisors but using their own judgement and past experience
(Perkins 2001). While this worked well in some instances, there was
also a call for clearer guidelines on accountability, “both for the
sake of the (lay health workers) and the health visitors who were
ultimately responsible” (Perkins 2001).


**Referral from health professionals to lay health workers (LHWs)**
**influenced by close ties**


In one US-based programme, clinic staff were expected to refer
women on to LHWs for breastfeeding support. According to the
LHWs, referrals were more frequent when the clinic was close to
the LHW’s office, where the relationship was communicative, and
where clinic staff were breastfeeding friendly (Meier 2007).


_**Service integration**_


In several studies, respondents pointed out that the LHW
programme could be strengthened if it was more strongly
integrated into other services, and if other services were more
aware of the programme. In the UK, recipients were happy with the
programme because it provided a 'seamless service' with individual
projects working together (Smith 2007). In another UK-based
programme, however, LHWs were concerned that if they were
working with a client, social work support would be withdrawn
because of a lack of understanding regarding the role of LHWs and
their limitations (Perkins 2001). In Uganda, LHWs provided HIV/

AIDs and reproductive health education in isolation from related
services such as condoms, pills or HIV testing (Siu 2009). In USA,
LHWs offering breastfeeding support wanted to develop ties to
clinic staff and hospital staff, to encourage breastfeeding and to
refer eligible patients to them (Meier 2007).


_**Social and cultural conditions**_


The studies sometimes referred to the manner in which
social conditions as well as societal beliefs and values
sometimes influenced LHW programme initiation, implementation
or acceptance in the community. For example, one study in
Papua New Guinea suggested that service changes that required
community involvement appeared to occur more readily among
recipients living in matrilineal regions because women had more
influence on initiating changes (Ashwell 2009). In Honduras,
community involvement was more successful where local leaders
were dynamic and responsive to community needs, while factors
such as economic hardship and rivalries among neighbours made
community involvement and collective action difficult (McQuestion
2010). In Malawi, the behaviour of a former government, where
people were forced to contribute to the support of party political
expenses, made it difficult for programmes to demand resources
from the community to support current programmes (Mkandawire
2005). In two studies, recipients living close to town appeared
to prefer health professionals over lay health workers (Kaufmann
1997; Khan 1998). In Canada, a home visiting programme was
made difficult to implement by the fact that recipients moved a
lot (Woodgate 2007). In Bangladesh, the norms of purdah posed
challenges to the movement of female LHWs from house to house
(Rashid 2001). In Kenya, the sale of supplements by LHWs was
negatively influenced by factors including post-election violence
closing roads and limiting people’s ability to work and access cash
(Suchdev 2010).


_**Donor policies and short-term thinking**_


In Nicaragua, one LHW programme was implemented in
collaboration between the Ministry of Health and national and
international NGOs; Ministry of Health (MOH) representatives
viewed this collaboration in a positive light. The authors
pointed to the fact that NGO representatives included former
MOH personnel, which implied a shared understanding of
their respective roles, functions and organisation culture and



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


encouraged close collaboration (George 2009). In Nepal, however,
policy makers and local programme staff were concerned about
what they regarded to be the short-term focus of outside
donor organisations (Glenton 2010). Respondents were critical
of donor organisations’ introduction of incentives, particularly
performance-based incentives, which they had poor experiences of
and which they regarded as unsustainable in the long term: “There
are many organizations (that) have implemented a programme and
need a report, so in order to (get) a report they do all sorts of things.
(But) this kind of small thing destroys the system, and as donors
or outsiders, they should really be strengthening the system and
making it work. But people don’t care about the motivation of the
FCHVs, just getting the work done. The Millennium Development
Goals are fine, but I think our children should live beyond the
Millennium Development Goals!” (Glenton 2010). In the same
study, respondents were also concerned that foreign donors and
organisations lacked sufficient understanding in the culture and
context of the country (Glenton 2010).


**2. Bringing together the results of the quantitative and**
**qualitative reviews in a logic model**


Our second objective was to integrate the findings of this qualitative
synthesis with the findings of the Cochrane review that assessed
LHW programme effectiveness (Lewin 2013). Ideally, the two
reviews would have included trials and qualitative studies that
assessed the same LHW programmes. However, before embarking
on this synthesis we did attempt to identify qualitative studies
that had been carried out alongside the randomised trials from
the effectiveness review, but had found very few that would have
been appropriate (Glenton 2011). Nevertheless, the two reviews do
include data from comparable types of programmes with regard
to the populations targeted, although more of the trials than the
qualitative studies were from high income countries. The studies
from both reviews were also similar with regard to the manner in
which LHWs were selected, trained and supervised, and the types
of tasks they delivered.


The logic model provided us with one approach to bringing
together the results of the two reviews. Here, the findings of the
qualitative review were organised into chains of events that we
proposed could lead to the outcomes measured in the review of

_**Integration of the lay health worker (LHW) programme with**_
_**other health services**_


In the first chain of events, the LHW programme is closely integrated
into the health system. Clinics are aware of and make use of LHW
services, and health professionals and LHWs work closely together.
This can lead to better relationships between the LHW and the
health professional, which in turn can lead to increased referral to
and from LHWs and increases their willingness and ability to deliver
services. This can lead to better quality services and to improved
health outcomes for mothers and children.


This chain of events may be threatened or enhanced in a number of
ways. Good relationships may be threatened if health professionals
are concerned that LHWs are overconfident or unskilled, or if they
are concerned about their own loss of authority or added workload.
On the other hand, relationships may be strengthened if health
professionals see LHWs as decreasing their workload and bringing
supplementary skills and knowledge, and if the relationship is
characterised by respect, support and egalitarianism.


Although a good relationship between LHWs and health
professionals may lead to increased referral, this process may
be threatened if the healthcare recipients themselves have poor
relationships to health professionals, if there is a lack of transport
or funds to get to the health facilities, or if the facilities are so poorly
staffed that recipients are deterred from attending. Increased
referral may be more likely, on the other hand, if recipients who are
accompanied by LHWs receive preferential treatment.


_**Lay health worker (LHW) working conditions, training and**_
_**supervision**_


In the second chain of events, the LHWs see their incentives as
consistent and predictable, appropriate and fair in relation to their
tasks and level of training, and they have a career pathway. They
have opportunities to share experiences with other LHWs and
they have systems whereby they can voice their complaints. They
have good physical working conditions and adequate supplies,
a reasonable workload, and manageable distances to cover.
Because the LHWs both live and work in the community their
working conditions are flexible. They are given sufficient, relevant
and high quality training, including training in counselling and
communication, and have adequate and skilled supervision. These
components can increase their willingness and ability to deliver
services, which in turn can lead to better quality services and to
improved health outcomes for mothers and children.


This chain of events may be threatened in a number of ways. While
LHWs may have a reasonable workload and manageable distances
to cover, gender roles or safety issues may prevent their movement
in the community. While the LHWs may feel that their incentives are
appropriate, recipients may question the motivation and credibility
of LHWs who are salaried rather than volunteers. While they may



receive sufficient training, they may experience fear, or blame from
the community, if the services they deliver are not successful. All of
these issues may thereby threaten their willingness and ability to
deliver care.


_**User fees**_


In the third chain of events, LHW services are either free or very
affordable. This can lead to increased utilization of LHW services,
and finally to improved health outcomes for mothers and children.


_**Lay health worker (LHW) selection criteria**_


In the fourth chain of events, LHWs are selected because they
live in the community already, or are in other ways socially
similar to recipients, and because they possess certain personal
characteristics such as trustworthiness, respect, kindness and
empathy. This can lead to good relationships between LHWs and
recipients thereby to increase recipient uptake of services and
improve health outcomes for mothers and children.


This chain of events may be threatened if recipients prefer not to
discuss sensitive topics with local LHWs or LHWs of the 'wrong'
gender. In addition, LHWs may find it difficult to maintain emotional
boundaries with recipients who live close by or who they develop
a close relationship to.


_**Support and participation from credible sources**_


In the fifh chain of events, the formal health system, community
structures and local leaders visibly support and participate in the
LHW programme. Decision makers at the household level also
actively support and participate in the programme. This can lead
recipients to view the LHWs as legitimate and credible, to have
confidence in their knowledge and skills and to view their services
as relevant and valuable, and gives the LHWs social recognition
and empowerment. This in turn can lead to good relationships
between LHWs and recipients and can also increase the willingness
and ability of LHWs to deliver services. This pathway may be
undermined if the health system or the community structures or
leaders that offer support to the LHWs are regarded as poorly
functioning or they are without authority or respect.


In addition, the participation of community members can lead to
community empowerment, defined here as "the means by which
individuals within community contexts have opportunities to gain
experience and skills to transform their own lives and their living
situation" (Rifkin 2001).


**3. Using the logic model to identify hypotheses for subgroup**
**analyses in the review of effectiveness**


The final objective of this synthesis was to identify hypotheses for
subgroup analyses in the Cochrane review of the effectiveness of
LHW programmes. As part of the development of the logic model,
we identified programme components, that is planned elements

of the LHW programme that we propose could ultimately lead
to the outcomes described in the review of effectiveness. These
components include the following.


- The close integration of the LHW programme into the health
system.

- Visible support from the health system.

- Close collaboration between individual LHWs and health
professionals.

- The active support and participation of community structures,
local leaders, and household decision makers.

- Free or affordable LHW services.

- The selection of LHWs that live in the community, or are
otherwise socially similar so recipients, and that possess certain
personal characteristics such as trustworthiness, respect,
kindness and empathy.

- Consistent and predictable incentives that LHWs regard as
appropriate and fair in relation to their tasks and level of
training.

- A LHW career pathway.

- Opportunities to share experiences with other LHWs.

- Systems where LHWs can voice their complaints.

- Flexible and appropriate working conditions and adequate
supplies.

- A reasonable workload and manageable distances to cover.

- Sufficient, relevant, high quality training, including in
counseling and communication.

- Adequate skilled supervision.


In future updates of the review of LHW effectiveness, authors could
explore the extent to which the presence of these components
influences the success of the programmes. This would require
that trials report on these components. The importance of these
components may vary for different types of programmes. For
instance, programmes primarily offering breastfeeding support
may be less dependent on visible support from the health
system and close collaboration with health professionals than
programmes offering treatment for sick children. More work is
needed to explore how trials of LHW programmes should be
grouped when testing these hypotheses.


**D I S C U S S I O N**


**Summary of main results**


This synthesis included 53 qualitative studies from diverse
countries and settings. The synthesis identified a number of
potential barriers and facilitators to the successful implementation
of lay health worker (LHW) programmes, including factors tied
to the relationship between LHWs and community members,
and between these two groups and health professionals. Other
identified barriers and facilitators included factors tied to LHW
training, supervision, working conditions, incentives and selection
criteria, and the integration of the programmes into the health
system.


While we explored whether there were differences between high,
middle and low income countries in the barriers and facilitators
we identified, the differences we did find were perhaps surprisingly
few. Many of the findings were based on studies from high, middle
and low income countries, suggesting that distinctions other than



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


the low and middle income country with high income country
divisions ofen used by both study and review authors may be more
relevant for future reviews.


Some differences between settings did emerge, however.
Situations where LHWs were approached about issues outside the
scope of their training were more ofen reported in low and middle
income countries, probably reflecting the general lack of services
available in these countries. Visible support from community
leaders and from the health system also appeared to play a larger
role for the credibility of LHWs in these countries, which may
reflect differences in social structures between high and low or
middle income countries. While the relationship between LHWs
and recipients was described in very similar ways in all settings,
with an emphasis on the importance of trust, respect, kindness and
empathy, recipients from high income countries were more likely
to emphasise the importance of LHWs as a source of emotional
and social support, and to compare lay health workers to friends
or family members. It is possible that recipients in these studies,
usually members of vulnerable populations in urban settings, were
less likely to have access to supportive social networks. Finally, the
importance of social recognition and respect was mainly reported
among LHWs in low and middle income countries. This may
have been influenced by the fact that most LHWs in high income
countries received regular payment, while the situation was far
more mixed among LHWs in low and middle income countries. The
LHWs’ reasons for becoming LHWs and the factors likely to motivate
them may therefore have varied.


We also set out to explore whether there were differences in the
barriers and facilitators we identified between trained TBAs and
other types of LHWs. However, the fact that the trained TBAs usually
carried out different tasks than the other LHWs made meaningful
comparison difficult.


**Overall completeness and applicability of evidence**


A majority of the included studies focused on the perspectives of
the LHWs themselves, their recipients, and the health professionals
that worked alongside or supervised them. Almost none of the
studies explored the perspectives of policy makers, programme
planners and managers or community leaders. We were therefore
unable to explore these stakeholders' views and experiences. This
type of data could have added important information about higher
level circumstances and decisions, for instance with regard to the
establishment and running of the programmes. In addition, an
understanding of these stakeholders' values and priorities could
have allowed us to compare their values and priorities with those
of stakeholders at ground level, as differences between the groups
could represent important barriers to programme success.


We aimed to include a sample of studies from a range of
geographical settings. However, the pragmatic decision to only
include English language studies affected our ability to include
evidence coming from certain regions, including Latin America.
While we did try to address this issue by showing particular lenience
towards Latin American studies when applying our inclusion
criteria, we were still only able to include a few studies from this
region.

**Quality of the evidence and certainty of the findings**


Almost all of the included studies used individual or group
interviews. Very few studies made use of long-term ethnographic
approaches, where observation of processes as they unfold in their
natural environment is a primary component. While the use of
individual or group interviews allow researchers to collect data on
what people say, observational methods also allow researchers to
explore what people actually do, and would therefore have been
particularly appropriate "for studying how organisations work, the
roles played by different staff and the interaction between staff
and clients" (Pope 2008). Qualitative interviews appear to be the
most commonly used approach among qualitative researchers in
the field of health services research, perhaps because this method
is usually less time-consuming than observational studies. It is
possible that additional searches in non-health related databases
would have allowed us to identify studies where the researcher
had studied a LHW programme in one setting over a longer
period of time using ethnographic methods of data collection.
The identification of such studies is something that should be
considered in an update of this review.


This lack of in-depth, long-term studies was also one of the reasons
why we assessed that none of our findings were of high certainty.
We did assess a number of our findings to be of moderate certainty,
however, as the findings were based on relatively well-conducted
studies that showed high levels of coherence.


**Agreements and disagreements with other studies or**
**reviews**


This synthesis was one of a series of reviews that aimed
to inform the World Health Organization's 'Recommendations
for Optimizing Health Worker Roles to Improve Access to
key Maternal and Newborn Health Interventions through Task
Shifing' (OPTIMIZEMNH) (WHO 2012). Other syntheses of
qualitative research that were carried out in connection with this
work included a review of LHWs and their use of compact prefilled autodisabled devices (Glenton 2013) and a multi-country
case study synthesis of LHW and other task shifing programmes
to optimise the health workforce (Gopinathan 2013). In addition,
syntheses of qualitative research on barriers and facilitators to
doctor-nurse substitution (Rashidian 2013) and to task shifing in
midwifery services (Colvin 2013) were carried out. In addition to
cadre-specific considerations, these four syntheses highlighted a
set of considerations and concerns similar to those identified in the
current synthesis, including challenges with existing training and
supervision; the importance of the relationship between different
types of health workers for health worker motivation and service
delivery; and the issue of accountability when health workers
are asked to deliver specific services that may place them in a
position of social or legal liability. These syntheses also supported
the idea that recipients of health care may be willing to accept
services from 'lower level' health workers and may in some cases
prefer these health workers, although there may be important
exceptions. In addition, the country case synthesis was able to
expand our understanding of these phenomena by describing
how 'upstream' factors such as regulatory decisions, financing
decisions, management and administration could influence the
success of these types of initiatives (Gopinathan 2013).


Several other efforts have been made to understand factors that
can influence the success of LHW programmes across settings and



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


for both maternal and child health and other healthcare areas.
These include Kane 2010, where evidence from 10 randomised
trials of child health interventions in low and middle income
settings was extracted and a realist approach was adopted to
explore the working of the interventions. The findings from this
synthesis are similar to our own and emphasised the importance
of training, supervision and good referral systems. The synthesis
also describes the importance of close ties between the LHW and
the community and their impact on recipient relationships and
the LHW's motivation and sense of responsibility. In addition, the
synthesis describes how the nature of the relationship between
the LHW and the local health services can influence the LHW's
legitimacy and credibility. Our own synthesis reflects these findings
but also elaborates on them, for instance by describing how close
relationships between LHWs and recipients can be problematic for
both parts, and by describing how any legitimacy offered by the
health system depends on the legitimacy of the health system itself.
The relative depth of our own synthesis compared to Kane's realist
synthesis probably reflects the fact that the randomised trials were
not designed to offer this type of information, an issue also noted
by the authors (Kane 2010).


Another effort to explore LHW programmes was made by the
Global Health Workforce Alliance in 2010 (Bhutta 2010). This group
carried out country case studies of programmes in eight low
and middle income countries using published and unpublished
reports and through direct contact with key personnel. Their report
points to a number of factors that appear to limit programme
success, including shortage of supplies and equipment, inadequate
education and supervision, low status and remuneration, and
inadequate linkages to the health system. However, the main
output of these studies was to document how each country
programme is organised and the extent to which it functions
effectively, rather than to explore specific barriers and across
programmes, and these topics are therefore only superficially
covered.


Lehmann and Sanders' literature review from 2007 (Lehmann 2007)
also has a developing country focus but is otherwise broad in
scope and includes both programmatic and academic studies.
The review examines the history of LHW programmes, who the
LHWs are in terms of gender, age, status etc, and the roles
and activities they perform. In addition, the review describes
existing literature that has assessed LHW performance, programme
use, retention and attrition, programme effectiveness and costeffectiveness, and presents findings regarding LHW programme
management, governance, ownership and accountability. While
the aim of the review is to describe what we currently know about
these programmes, rather than to analyse barriers or facilitators
to programme success, the review does point to a number
of lessons learnt from the literature, including the importance
of training, management, supervision, logistics, appropriate
incentives and community embeddedness. In addition, their
inclusion of programmatic evidence may have given the authors a
better insight into issues tied to management and governance than
we were able to achieve with our focus on academic studies.


Jaskiewicz and Tulenko's review (Jaskiewicz 2012) includes
published and unpublished articles and reports of LHW
programmes in developing countries. This review focuses
specifically on the working conditions of LHWs and the impact
these may have on work productivity. While their findings are

similar to the findings from our own synthesis, their focus on this
one aspect of the LHW programme allows them to explore this topic
in greater detail.


These reviews of LHW programmes have all focused on low and
middle income countries, while our own inclusion of studies from
all regions has allowed us to explore similarities and differences
across regions. Other differences between these reviews and the
current synthesis are the aim of the review and the choice of
literature. Our own synthesis aimed specifically to identify barriers
and facilitators to LHW programmes and only included studies
where the primary focus was the experiences and attitudes of
stakeholders towards these programmes, while the other reviews
had more varied aims. In addition, our own synthesis only included
qualitative studies, while the other reviews either included data
from randomised trials, studies using several research designs,
or both programmatic reports and academic studies. There are
advantages and disadvantages to our own approach. While the
inclusion of studies that are similar in aim and in methods may
have allowed us to compare topics in more depth, this may also
have narrowed the type of data we had access to and may,
for instance, explain why we have identified few barriers and
facilitators concerning higher level issues such as management and
governance.


**The use of novel methodological approaches in the**
**synthesis**


While methods for synthesising qualitative studies are becoming
more common, this is still a relatively new approach and agreement
on how best to carry out such syntheses is still emerging. Methods
to assess the certainty of findings are even more novel. Our
development of the Cerqual approach, and its use in this and other
OPTIMIZEMNH-related syntheses (Colvin 2013; Rashidian 2013),
is therefore relatively innovative, although the similarities and
differences to the GRADE approach are discussed in the methods
section. While the logic model approach is well-established as a
means of describing how programmes might work, its use in the
integration of findings from reviews of qualitative and effectiveness
studies is novel.


Another approach to integrating the findings from these two types
of reviews is to develop a matrix that juxtaposes recommendations
for interventions derived from the synthesis of qualitative evidence
against the actual interventions assessed in the review of
effectiveness (Candy 2011). We chose to explore the logic model
approach for pragmatic reasons, as our summary of qualitative
findings tables appeared to lend themselves well to this approach.
However, we would like to explore the matrix approach in future
updates of this review.


The aim of our logic model approach was to suggest how
the barriers and facilitators we had identified in the synthesis
could impact on outcomes assessed in the review of programme
effectiveness. Two intermediate outcomes that were included in
the logic model but that were not included in the effectiveness
review involved LHWs' willingness and ability to deliver services
and good relationships between LHWs and recipients. Many
of the barriers and facilitators identified in the synthesis refer
directly or indirectly to the impact of certain situations on these
outcomes, and they were therefore added to the model. Some
measurement of LHW motivation or work satisfaction as well as
some measurement of the LHW-recipient relationship would be



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


useful to include in future trials and reviews of LHW programme
effectiveness.


When carrying out the synthesis, we used a theory-informed
conceptual framework, the SURE Framework, to guide our
identification of themes and categories (The SURE Collaboration
2011). The SURE Framework offered us a useful starting point
for our analysis as it provided us with a comprehensive list of
possible factors that could influence intervention success. It also
allowed us to link the findings from this synthesis to the findings
from the other syntheses developed as part of the OPTIMIZEMNH
work, and to the broader debate around task shifing among all
cadres of health workers. But while the framework encouraged
us to compartmentalise findings into specific categories, such
as stakeholder attitudes or health system constraints, the logic
model approach encouraged us to think through relationships and
processes across and between these categories.


One criticism of the logic model approach is that it is too
reductionistic. Several of the components and moderators we
identified represent complex phenomena in themselves, such as
the issue of LHW incentives and motivation, and could have had a
model of their own. Furthermore, LHW programmes are embedded
in particular sociopolitical contexts and specific health systems
with specific governance, financial and delivery arrangements. We
were not able to explore the interaction between these contexts and
the proposed chains of events because the studies rarely reported
this type of data. Another limitation of our logic model is that
we chose to present it as a linear process and did not indicate
possible feedback loops or interactive cycles even though this
could have been done. While any synthesis of research studies
requires that studies are to a greater or lesser degree simplified and
decontextualised, the logic model takes this process even further.


"A logic model is, by necessity, an abstraction that omits detail
for the sake of clarity of representation" (Williams 2009), and a
balance needs to be struck between reflecting the complexity
of the findings while creating a model that might be useful
and understandable. While simplicity is one of the weaknesses
of the logic model, it is possibly also one of its strengths, as
it can be used to develop practical information for programme
planners regarding the optimal design of LHW programmes. At
the same time, this use depends on the programme planner's
ability to place this information in his or her own context, as is
the case for findings from reviews of effectiveness (Lavis 2009).
The logic model may be a useful tool for trial and review authors
as it can be used to suggest relevant outcomes and subgroup
analyses. In addition, qualitative researchers can further explore
the connections between components and outcomes that are
assumed in the model.


The integration of the two reviews in the logic model was made
easier by the fact that there was overlap in review authorship. The
logic model was carried out by researchers who were co-authors of,
and therefore very familiar with, both reviews.

Rather than being seen as a lesser trained health worker, lay health
workers may represent a different and sometimes preferred type
of health worker. The ofen close relationship between lay health

workers and their recipients is a strength of such programmes.
However, programme planners must consider how best to achieve
the benefits of closeness while minimizing the drawbacks. Other
factors that may be important include the development of services
that recipients perceive as relevant; regular and visible support
from other health workers and from community leaders; and
sufficient training, supervision and incentives.


**Implications for research**


Future qualitative studies of lay health worker programmes
should consider exploring the perceptions of a broader group
of stakeholders, including programme planners and managers,
policy makers and community leaders. This could give us a better
understanding of barriers and facilitators to the establishment and
management of lay health worker programmes, and could allow us
to compare these stakeholders' values and priorities with those of
stakeholders on the ground.


Future qualitative studies should consider making use of
observational methods in order to explore stakeholders' actions
within and in response to the programmes.


Future trials of lay health worker programme effectiveness
should offer more information about how the lay health workers
are selected, trained, supervised, and incentivised; how the
programme is incorporated into the rest of the health system; and
what role, if any, community structures play in the establishment
and management of the programmes.



Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews


Future trials of lay health worker programme effectiveness should
also consider including some measure of lay health worker
motivation or work satisfaction as well as some measure of the lay
health worker-recipient relationship.


Future reviews of qualitative research that are carried out alongside
reviews of intervention effectiveness should aim to include some
overlap of authors as the presence of authors that are familiar with
the studies and results of both reviews is a great advantage to
review integration.

Ahmed 2006 UK-based study. Excluded because of lack of focus on review question and small amount of data.
Also, this is an evaluation of a Sure Start programme, of which we already have two included


Ainbinder 1998 USA-based study. Excluded because of low relevance for review question. The focus of the paper
was on social support for children with special needs, which we defined as slightly outside the
scope of maternal and child health


Attree 2004 UK-based study. Excluded because of overlap with other included studies (Evaluation of a Sure
Start programme, of which we already have two included)


Carr 2005 UK-based study. Excluded because of low relevance for review question. The focus of the paper was
on child accident prevention, which we defined as slightly outside the scope of maternal and child
health


Cupples 2011 UK-based study. Excluded because it is the same study as Murphy, and Murphy presents more or
less the same data


Farquhar 2006 USA-based study. Excluded because of lack of focus on review question. The focus of the paper is to
describe how the LHWs used qualitative methods to plan programmes


Hoddinott 2006 UK-based study. Excluded because of low focus on review question. Most of the focus is on the
breastfeeding groups run by health professionals. Very little data on the LHW personal coaches


Ingram 2005 UK-based study. Excluded because of low focus on review question. Also covers a questionnaire
study and the data are relatively thin

Lagendyk 2005 Canada-based study. Excluded because of low focus on review question. The main focus of the
study is not stakeholders’ perceptions of the LHW programme, but how two LHW programmes
were merged


Lavender 2005 UK-based study. Excluded because of lack of focus on review question (main focus is mothers’
views of breastfeeding)


Locklin 1995 USA-based study. Excluded because of low focus on review question. The primary focus is on
women’s experiences of breastfeeding, and only parts of it are about their views of the LHW programme


Martens 2002 Canada-based study. Excluded because of low focus on review question. Also covers a quantitative
study and the qualitative data are relatively thin


Moran 2006 UK-based study. Excluded because of low focus on review question. Focuses on midwives’ and LHWs’ views and attitudes of breastfeeding support rather than on the LHW programme


Paris 2008 USA-based study. Excluded because of low focus on review question. A lot of the results section focused on the experiences of immigrant mothers that were not directly relevant to the programme


Raine 2003b UK-based study. Excluded because this is the same study as Raine 2003 and presents more or less
the same data


Schroeder 2005 USA-based study. Excluded because of low relevance to the review question. The study took place
in jail, and much of the date focuses on the experience of birth and the role of the doula in this particular setting


Scott 2003 UK-based study. Excluded because of low focus on review question. The primary focus is on
women’s experiences of breastfeeding, and only a small part deals with their views of the LHW programme


Smith 2004 UK-based study. Excluded because of overlap with other included studies (evaluation of a UKbased programme with breastfeeding support focus). Also relatively thin description


Suppiah 1994 UK-based study. Excluded because of overlap with other included studies (evaluation of a programme based in the UK and with a focus on breastfeeding support, nutrition and parenting skills)


Wade 2009 UK-based study. Excluded because of low focus on review question. Also, study very similar to other UK-based studies of breastfeeding and thin description


Zadoroznyj 2006 Australia-based study. Excluded because of low relevance for review question. The focus of the paper was on home support, including domestic and social support, which we defined as slightly outside the main scope of maternal and child health

1. Both programme recipients and LHWs emphasised
the importance of trust, respect, kindness and empathy
in the LHW-recipient relationship.


2. Recipients appreciated the similarities they saw between themselves and the LHWs.


3. Some LHWs expressed an appreciation of the community-based nature of the programmes, which allowed them a certain amount of flexibility in their
working hours.


4. LHWs were compared favourably with health professionals, whom recipients often regarded as less accessible, less friendly, more intimidating, and less respectful.


5. Some recipients who had easy access to doctors indicated a preference for these health professionals.


6. LHWs reported difficulties in managing emotional relationships and boundaries with recipients.


7. Some recipients were concerned that home visits
from LHWs might lead the LHWs to observe and share
personal information or might lead neighbours to think
recipients were HIV-positive.

8. LHWs, particularly those working in urban settings,
reported difficulties maintaining personal safety when
working in dangerous settings or at night.


9. In some settings, gender norms meant that female
LHWs could not easily move within their community to
fulfil their responsibilities.

blame if interventions delivered to other community
members were unsuccessful.

1. Some recipients failed to utilize LHW services because of concerns about intervention safety or a lack of understanding about
the programme or the benefits of the intervention.


2. Some recipients failed to utilize LHW services because they
could not afford these services.


3. Recipients sometimes perceived LHW services as not relevant
to their needs or not sufficient, particularly when services focused on promotional activities.


4. Recipients’ and LHWs’ perceptions of the LHW services as not
relevant or not sufficient could lead to feelings of impotence and
demotivation among the LHWs. LHWs who primarily offered promotional and counselling services sometimes expressed a need
to offer "real healthcare" in order to better respond to the expressed needs of the community.


5. Recipients expressed confidence in the knowledge and skills of
the LHWs and saw them as a useful source of information.


6. LHW credibility was believed by different stakeholders to be
heightened through visible ties to the health system. These ties
were emphasised through, for example, LHWs’ possession of
equipment and their ability to refer directly to clinics.


7. Visible ties to the health system could enhance LHW credibility, but not always. In one study where community members had
little respect for health professionals, LHWs attempted to disassociate themselves by emphasizing their status as unpaid volun

they received payment.


8. LHW credibility and acceptance was believed to be strengthened through the active support and participation of community
leaders and community structures. However, the success of this
type of involvement was seen as useful primarily where community leaders had authority and respect.


9. LHW credibility and acceptance was believed to be strengthened through the active support and participation of family
members involved in health decision-making.

it embarrassing to communicate about family planning or HIV
counselling.

21. Where LHWs described good relationships with health professionals, they referred to these relationships as being respectful, supportive and egalitarian, and where LHWs were regarded
as possessing complementary and valuable skills.


22. In studies where health professionals expressed appreciation of LHWs, they emphasised the LHWs’ contribution to the
health professionals’ busy workload; their skills in communicating with the target population and their knowledge and experience of the issues at hand; and their commitment and dedication to their patients and the community.


23. In studies describing poor relationships between LHWs and
health professionals, LHWs were regarded as unequal, subservient, not part of the organisation, and LHWs complained of
arrogance and lack of respect from health professionals.


24. In a few studies, health professionals described problems
with working with LHWs. These health professionals pointed to
the tension between being expected to function as partners, supervisors and evaluators, added workloads, and fear that they
would lose authority.


25. Some studies suggested that the closer the collaboration
was between the health professional and the LHW, the better
the relationship was likely to be.

**Lay health worker motivation and incentives**



26. LHWs were driven by a wide range of inter-connected motives, both intrinsic and extrinsic, including altruism and social engagement, social status and recognition, knowledge and
skills gain, career development, and a general sense of empowerment. These motives were seen across a range of settings although the issue of social recognition appeared to be less common in HIC settings, where LHWs were often not from the same
neighbourhood as their clients.


27. Some unsalaried LHWs expressed a strong wish for regular
payment.


28. Some salaried LHWs were dissatisfied with their wages, believing that it did not reflect their abilities, their level of responsibility or their increase in skills as they acquired further training and education.


29. Some volunteer LHWs and other stakeholders expressed
concern that payment would change the dynamics of the LHWclient relationship, threaten the LHWs’ social status or lead recipients to question the LHWs’ motives for delivering services.
Some stakeholders underlined the importance of understanding what LHW motivations are in each context and the necessity of ensuring that the expectations of LHWs, programme managers and policy makers are in alignment.


30. Changes in tasks could influence expectations regarding incentives. For instance, while some LHWs were willing to work
as volunteers when tasks could be done at their leisure, activities that demanded that they were present during labour and
birth implied irregular and unpredictable working conditions,
and led to demands for monetary incentives.


31. While regular salaries were not part of many programmes,
other monetary and non-monetary incentives, including payment to cover out-of-pocket expenses and “work tools” such
as bicycles, uniforms or ID badges, were greatly appreciated by
LHWs.


32. Some LHWs who received payment through selling drugs
and supplements encountered problems including an inflated
idea of the profit they would be making; people buying drugs
on credit purchase basis or being reluctant to buy drugs because of their perception that the LHWs got the drugs for free;
and competition from other vendors.

35. LHWs highlighted aspects of training
that they saw as positive including the use
of practical demonstrations, picture cards
and frequent refresher training.


36. In general, however, LHWs highlighted
a number of weaknesses with current training, including schedules not flexible enough
to respond to LHW turnover, poor quality
and irrelevant training programmes and unskilled trainers.


37. LHWs asked for more training in counselling and communication, a task which
is often central to the role of the LHWs, but
which they often found to be complex to
perform.


38. Some LHWs wanted training in topics
outside of their current role, including common health problems, birth complications,
sexual abuse and domestic violence, substance abuse and housing difficulties. These
requests appeared to reflect the LHWs’ need
to respond to the expressed needs of the
community and to the circumstances they
were confronted with in their work.


39. Supervision was seen as important by
programme staff and LHWs for quality of intervention delivery, and as an opportunity
to give and receive support, guidance and
continued training; assess skills; and address ongoing challenges. Despite this acknowledgement of the importance of supervision, however, the studies pointed to a
number of problems including supervisors’

40. A small number of studies described supervision that was perceived to be good.
Here, supervisors displayed respect to the
LHW; had a good understanding of the
LHW’s working conditions and personal circumstances; provided emotional and technical support; and carried out plentiful field
visits.


41. In addition to formal supervision, some
LHWs also appreciated the opportunity to
share experiences with other LHWs


42. Both LHWs and supervisors in a number
of studies expressed concern about the LHWs’ workload and the distances they had to
cover, and LHWs sometimes found it difficult to carry out all of their tasks because of
this.

to poor working conditions, including inadequate lighting and small, dirty rooms, lack
of supplies, too much paperwork, and high

44. LHWs in a number of studies were trained to refer patients with
complications on to health professionals. However, health professionals in one study were concerned that trained TBAs were overconfident about their ability to manage danger signs or lacked the
knowledge to recognise such signs. Overconfidence was also suggested by authors of another study as a reason for poor compliance
among LHWs who were meant to refer children with malaria on.


45. The LHWs themselves and their recipients pointed to different
factors that made referral difficult to those highlighted by health
professionals. Some trained TBAs and recipients pointed out that
referral was made difficult by a lack of health professionals to refer
patients to.


46. LHWs also pointed to clients’ own reluctance to access care,
partly due to bad experiences with health professionals, fear of caesarean sections, and concerns over cost.

47. Trained TBAs in some studies were also reluctant to refer
women on because of the poor treatment and lack of cooperation
the TBAs themselves experienced from health professionals.


48. Other obstacles to referral were logistical factors, particularly the lack of transport necessary to move the woman to the clinic, but also lack of money to pay for transport or a telephone with
which to call an ambulance.


49. In two studies, where LHWs were not TBAs, patients accompanied by LHWs were given preferential treatment by clinic staff.


**Service integration**


50. Some studies suggest that LHW programmes could be strengthened by a stronger integration into other services.


**Social and cultural conditions**


51. Some studies described how social conditions, societal beliefs
and values influenced LHW programme initiation, implementation
or acceptance. Examples of this included differences in community
organisation and cohesion, proximity to town and gender roles.

CG, SL, and CC conceptualised the review. CG, CC, BC, AS, SL, JN and AR designed the approach and prepared the protocol. Marit Johansen
developed the search strategy. CG, CC, BC and AS actively participated in all stages of the review (conducting the search, obtaining data,
data extraction, data synthesis, and review preparation). SL, JN and AR contributed to the interpretation of the evidence, development of
the logic model, and editing of the review.
