Agents of care and agents of the state: bio-power and nursing practice
Aim. This paper presents a conceptual analysis of the concept of bio-power in the
context of nursing, including a critique of the widespread rhetoric that nursing is
deprived of power and consequently is an apolitical agency.
Background. Traditionally, power tends to be defined in terms of repression,
interdiction and punishment. On the contrary, work by Michel Foucault with regard
to bio-power brings into evidence the productive and positive nature of power at the
heart of society. Despite being often used by various academic and professional
disciplines, the concept of bio-power is rarely cited in nursing.
Findings. Nursing as a profession is at the heart of bio-power in that nurses lie at
the crossroads between the anatomo-political and bio-political ranges of power over
life. They therefore contribute to social regulation through a vast array of diverse
political technologies. Nurses are at the flexing point of the state’s requirements and
of individual and collective aspirations. They occupy a strategic position that allows
them to act as instruments of governmentality. Consequently, nurses constitute a
fully-fledged political entity making use of disciplinary technologies and responding
to state ideologies.
Conclusion. The concept of bio-power offers a rich theoretical perspective for
nursing, as it questions the definition of nursing care as neutral and mainly provided
according to patients’ best interests.


Keywords: bio-power, concept analysis, Foucault, nursing practice, nursing theory,
politics



A number of sociologists and philosophers such as Marx,
Nietzsche and Weber, have discussed the notion of power
and have generally defined it in terms of repression and
prohibition. French philosopher Michel Foucault, however,
defined it as a positive and productive force (Dreyfus &
Rabinow 1982, Saari 1999, Foucault 2002a, 2002b). The
concept of bio-power encompasses many indicators of the



interconnectedness between individuals and the state. The
state is understood as a legislative, politically organized body
concerned with the government of a population and a
territory (Rose 1999). Bio-power is characterized by the
interconnection of two axes: anatomo-political (discipline of
the body) and bio-political (population management). The
organization of power over life stems from these two axes
(Foucault 2002b). In his books ‘Discipline and Punish’ and
‘History of Sexuality’, Foucault (2002a, 2002b) first described

the process through which bio-power instituted various
norms dedicated to the government of individuals as well as
entire populations (Dean 1999).
Foucault also established a parallel between bio-power and
the birth of human sciences during the 19th century. Human
sciences reflect a tendency for normalization and account for
the division between what is considered ‘normal’ and
‘pathological’ (Dreyfus & Rabinow 1982). They serve to
categorize behaviours, thoughts and desires along a deviant
to desirable continuum and develop a body of knowledge,
which promotes the establishment of comparative norms,
designed to manage individuals, understand their desires and
predict their behaviours. This body of knowledge yields
expert discourses that are appropriated by professionals,
including nurses. As a result of their scientific knowledge,
nurses are granted authority over patients by the state.
Nursing discourses lead individuals to adopt specific, predetermined behaviours that serve the logic of bio-power
towards a homogeneous and ordered society that lives up
to the expectations of the state.
In this paper, we seek to establish a link between nursing
practice and bio-power, and to illustrate its theoretical
relevance to nursing practice. A current view in nursing
conveys the idea that nurses are devoid of power (Erlen &
Frost 1991, DeMarco & Roberts 2003), although this
representation has been challenged (Holmes & Gastaldo
2002). Seen through the lens of bio-power, reality is radically
different: the state confers on nurses an authority that
includes stipulated norms that are conveyed to patients.
Foucault’s work poses a challenge, if not a threat, to the
widely-accepted humanistic discourse in nursing. It allows for
the deconstruction of major concepts, which have tended to
guide both nursing literature and nursing practice: ‘there are
many other complementary and competing nursing discourses and consequent constructions of nursing, yet the narratives of ‘helping’ can be seen as a dominant or hegemonic
discourse’ (Francis 2000, p. 23). The study of bio-power
allows collective awareness (both academic and professional)
of nursing practice as a political endeavour.


Power


According to Foucault (2002a), power aims to exploit bodies
(actions and energy) in order to turn them into a useful and
productive workforce. Power is not owned, but is exerted
(Foucault 2002a). Contrary to traditional representations in
the works of Marx (1946) and Weber (1986), power neither
belong to a privileged class of wealthy individuals who
exercise it on classes of lower socioeconomic status (Marx),
nor does it belong to a small group of people who occupy a



position of legitimate authority at the heart of an organization, and impose their decisions upon others (Weber).
Instead, it permeates every layer of society, infusing both
individuals and the population as a whole. According to
Foucault, ‘its functioning is that of a network of relations
from top to bottom, but also to a certain extent from bottom
to top and laterally; this network ‘holds’ the whole together
and traverses it in its entirety’ (Foucault 1995, p. 176–177).
Historically, power has changed. Foucault (2002a) used
the following example of the power of the monarch to
recount the evolution of power over time and how it was
originally held by one individual who displayed it in
spectacular ways, and went on to become a subtle force
resting on several agents.
Until the 17th century, monarachy was the foundation of
power in France (Foucault 2002a). Anyone who challenged
the king’s authority instigated his wrath, and this took the
shape of spectacular public torture and executions. The
splendour of executions served as a deterrent, as they aimed
to eradicate any crime against the authority even before it
took place.
Torture became less significant towards the end of the 17th
century, as it sent contradictory messages to the masses: in
trying to eliminate violence it was actually amplified by
recreating, in an excessive manner, the offence that had been
committed (Foucault 2002a). The people soon became
increasingly outraged as they grew unable to bear the sight
of such spectacles. As a result, punishments became more
subtle. In order to end the arbitrary nature of sentences and
the resulting illegalities, the ‘penal code’ was introduced as a
means to ensure objective convictions. Imprisonment became
a useful solution to all crimes, ranging from minor transgressions to serious offences. Thus, during the 17th and 18th
centuries, the exercise of power passed from the king’s hand
to a network of coercion resting on a multitude of penal
agents. The sovereign’s authority alone was no longer
sufficient to govern ever-growing populations. The need,
rather, was for the infiltration of the social body by means of
homogeneous networks of power (medical, legal, political,
spiritual, educational, etc.) exerted over each and everyone
(Foucault 2002a). The new objective was to regulate life, to
manage it in its most intricate forms.


Bio-power


Bio-power or power over life, is a subtle and diffuse form of
power. Its purpose is to manage and administer individuals
and, by extension, communities and populations. The individual and collective characteristics that pose a threat to
the social order (Tremain 2001) must be looked after by

competent authorities in order to promote, restore or
maintain global well-being. Bio-power appeared throughout
the 18th century in response to a demographic explosion in
the Western world (Foucault 2002a). Contemporary governments faced a disorganized and potentially dangerous mass of
individuals, and thus resorted to various strategies designed
to preserve order (Foucault 2002a). Meticulous and subtle
management of every facet of these masses allowed for their
use for economic purposes, and thus laid the foundations of
capitalism. Unlike traditional (feudal) forms of power, biopower seeks to be more productive and less arbitrary, more
convincing without being spectacular (Foucault 2002a).
Bio-power embraces all aspects of life such as demographic
parameters of a population, health and security matters and
education. It takes charge of individuals and populations in a
way that Foucault has defined as having two poles: the
anatomo-political pole includes forms of power that address
individuals, while the bio-political pole concerns entire
populations (McHoul & Grace 1997). These two poles of
bio-power complement one another; however, their emergence was separate, and it was only towards the end of the
18th century that they converged. In the following sections
we examine both, and illustrate our analysis with various
examples pertaining to nursing practice.


Anatomo-politics


Anatomo-politics aims to produce technologies that serve to
exert a hold over others’ bodies, ‘not only so that they may do
what one wishes, but so that they may operate as one wishes’
(Foucault 1995, p. 138). A multitude of distinct processes are
internalized by individuals before being established in institutional structures. According to Foucault (2002a), it is these
various processes, which make up disciplines. Disciplines
may be defined as ‘methods, which made possible the
meticulous control of the operations of the body, which
assured the constant subjection of its forces and imposed
upon them a relation of docility-utility’ (Foucault 1995,
p. 137). They make possible the creation of submissive, yet
skillful, docile bodies through concerted actions of multiple
disciplinary technologies. Disciplinary technologies seek to
manage every aspect of life. Training is another component of
a discipline, and refers to the manufacturing and transformation of these bodies.


Docile bodies
Through the art of distributions (Foucault 2002a), the
seclusion of the individual within a well-defined space is first
accomplished in order to better monitor their moves.
Enclosure allows for the maintenance of strict social order



within various institutions such as hospitals, schools or
factories, where logical spatial distribution counteracts disorganization. However, enclosure is not enough. In order to
assure adequate surveillance, partitioning is instituted. Each
individual is confined to a specific place within the institution.
For instance, imprisonment of convicted felons implies their
distribution within prisons, quarters and cells (Foucault
2002a). Spatial organization within hospitals (departments,
units and rooms) also illustrates this.
Moreover, these subdivisions are then divided into functional sites in order to achieve both particular and general
surveillance: individuals are appointed to specific departments while the division of work according to various tasks is
established. Functional sites involve strategic distribution of
bodies, which allows for categorization according to their
common characteristics. The whole is then organized into
ranks, and this allows for spatial classification (for instance,
school or military ranks), but also hierarchical distribution
according to the abilities, knowledge, values and tasks of
each individual.
This constant ‘training’ of bodies results in the ‘control of
activity’. Timetables aim to break down all activities such
that each and every moment is exploited in an optimal
manner. Nurses’ activities are organized so as to ensure that
all tasks pertaining to patient care are completed in time.
Temporal elaboration of the act represents a culminating
point, as all activity is scrutinized in its finest detail.
Accordingly, each of the nurses’ activities is accomplished
in such a way as to minimize the use of time and energy.
Correlation of body and gesture serves to achieve the highest
degree of efficiency and speed. Under the gaze of the
supervisor, deviant behaviours will immediately be rectified,
such that an indelible print will be left on the subjects’
subconscious.
The body-object articulation illustrates the way in which
the manipulation of a tool (an object that moves beyond
passivity to one that serves a specific function) is broken
down according to a specific sequence. Healthcare techniques
constitute a good example of this, as in the example of
changing of a dressing following strict asepsis guidelines,
a procedure for which each gesture is predetermined. This
optimal use of time makes possible continuous production
combining efficiency and speed, doing more with less, and
using the body as an instrument of production (McHoul &
Grace 1997).
According to Foucault (1995), p.157 ‘Disciplines must also
be understood as machinery (techniques) for adding up and
capitalizing time’. For the organization of genesis (the way in
which subjects are trained), four processes come into play.
The division and organization of time ensure a constant

Nursing theory and concept development or analysis Bio-power and nursing practice



gathering of new knowledge following a methodological and
chronological sequence according to which one must master
basic exercises before moving on to a more complex level.
Each transition to a higher level involves a test that allows for
the categorization of individuals according to their abilities
and performance. Finally, series of activities are then implemented, such that each new learning process is tailored to an
individual’s skills, level or rank.
In order to achieve both docility and usefulness, the
strengths of each individual body must be amplified and
carefully managed. A body is placed and positioned in
relation to all the others and must then be taught to move in
conjunction with them, each one having a specific role to
fulfil. This positioning strategy is a determining factor in
maximizing strength. The goal is to obtain a whole that is
more powerful than the sum of its parts through what
Foucault calls the adjustment of time. When the supervisor,
teacher or commander gives the signal, the whole is set in
motion. Signalization is a common language that renders
words and explanations unnecessary. These three strategies
(positioning, adjustment of time and signalization) fall into
the composition of forces (Foucault 2002a), a process that
not only trains docile bodies but also sanctions needless,
unproductive and deviant behaviours. Thus, nurses are
expected to ensure that patients follow guidelines outlined
in their care plans in order to promote recovery.


Training of bodies
Disciplinary power proves to be successful, yet it relies on
rather simple technologies. Throughout the 18th century,
architecture was developed not to improve its external features but rather to focus on the interior layout of buildings in
such a manner as to assure constant, hierarchical observation.
Hierarchical observation is characterized by the fact that the
role of supervisors is subdivided in order to ensure a continuous monitoring of everyone. The result is a state similar
to ’s (1984) Oceania, a perfect society in which power seeps
into even the most intimate thoughts. Bentham (1843) envisioned a concrete application in the shape of The Panopticon,
an architectural structure consisting of a tower surrounded by
cells, where each cell is under constant surveillance by a
watchman in the tower. Thus, individuals are disciplined by
the fact that they are potentially under the constant supervision of the watchman. This flawless regulating apparatus
would be at its most concrete and appropriate form in prison
settings, and instills within each and everyone a continuous
state of exposure in a place where power is omnipresent
(McHoul & Grace 1997).
Normalizing judgment complements hierarchical observation by means of micropenalties, a system of gratification


punishment in which ranking serves as punishment or
reward. The goal is to reform deviant behaviours through
normalizing sanctions. For instance, psychiatric nurses caring
for anorexic patients whose weight falls below a predetermined value may suspend their privileges until they begin to
eat again and bring their weight to the desired level.
Finally, examination is instituted, which is a combination
of hierarchical surveillance and corrective normalization.
Training is thus achieved by means of qualification,
classification and normalization, perpetuating punishment
for unwanted behaviours (Foucault 2002a). Examination
evaluates each individual’s abilities and knowledge, analyses
new learning and behaviours and sanctions the weak, while
validating those performances that meet expectations. In
order to achieve such intricate control over individuals’
actions and thoughts, the state must come to know them
better than they know themselves. An individual must
therefore open up and confess their deepest secrets. Therapeutic listening techniques are a concrete example of examination. Nurses must bring their patients to an acceptance of
their diagnoses and a discussion of the resulting implications.
These indicators of anatomo-political power are illustrated in
Figure 1.
While the judicial system only punishes actions that are
forbidden by legislation, discipline sanctions behaviours that
are illegal but also those that do not infringe on the law. Its sole
purpose is to fulfil the goals determined by the institution
within which it is inscribed. Individualization is a necessary
step towards normalization (Foucault 2002a) and, while it
only concerned dignitaries during feudal regimes, it has
focused on individual subjects since the end of the classical age.
The establishment of norms dictated by ongoing ideology
constitutes one of the building blocks of discipline. These
norms serve as standards for discriminating between what is
considered desirable or ‘good’ and what is not. In this regard,
nurses play a determining role by encouraging ‘normal’,
healthy behaviours and dissuading those who transgress these
social tenets. Using the example of aboriginal communities,
we shall now examine the extent to which nurses serve as
instruments of anatomo-politics.


Nursing practice as an instrument of anatomo-politics


To understand power relations between government and
certain isolated aboriginal populations, it is necessary to go
back to the dawn of the 20th century. In the region of
Nunavik, northern Canada, the state became increasingly
influential in order to appropriate the fur trade and dominate
the northern territories which were rich with natural
resources (Duhaime 1985). By establishing trading posts,

however, the government contributed to the settling of the
Inuit people. Entire communities came to build their homes
near general stores where processed goods were easily
accessible. Healthcare services, which provided nursing care
among other things, first appeared around these trading posts
(Duhaime 1985). The state then proceeded to divide and
structure the local inhabitants by building better lodging for
settlers compared with that given to the Inuit, thus enhancing
the hierarchy within the population. For instance, housing



policies instituted social demarcation within the community
that was reinforced through spatial distribution of these
different types of accommodation (Duhaime 1985). Healthcare services were implemented, thus enabling the state to
create a socio-sanitary apparatus, in which nurses played a
determinant role. Although this occurred over a century ago,
nursing goals remain the same in today’s aboriginal communities as nurses are the leading healthcare authority in remote
Canadian regions. The power of health care, through its

directing and normalizing nature, serves as an instrument of
social control. Angus and Nay (2003) corroborate this, and
believe that surveillance and discipline regulations and
procedures characterize the discourse surrounding the care
of individuals. Nursing practice, whether preventive or
curative, thus becomes the vehicle of disciplinary technologies. Lupton (1997) states that power in the healthcare
system can be recognized by the existence of examinations,
measures and comparisons between individuals. When nurses
carry out such activities, the normalizing nature of their
interventions comes as no surprise. By combining these
techniques, nurses contribute to the construction of ‘cases’,
which are used to gather knowledge about ‘objects’ over
which nurses may thereafter exert power: ‘This turning of
real lives into writing is no longer a procedure of heroization;
it functions as a procedure of objectification and subjection’
(Foucault 1995, p. 192).
Healthcare professionals, including nurses, through constant exposure to the native population since colonization,
have attempted in the past and still continue today to instill
changes in behaviour by emphasizing objectives to be
reached. According to Gastaldo (1997), this approach is
mainly normative. Such transmission of information in a
procedural and directive manner would occur with the
majority of nurses, according to a study by Henderson
(2003) in which nurses are shown to be hesitant to share their
decision-making authority with patients.
Anatomo-political intervention allows for the management
and categorization of individual bodies, thereby uncovering
society’s weak links to identify those who are not conforming
to expectations. Whereas anatomo-politics focused on the
individual unit, towards the end of the 18th century this
process evolved into a large-scale operation – bio-politics.


Bio-politics


The management of large groups and eventually entire
populations was achieved progressively, concurrently with
that of individuals. Foucault (2002b) claimed that the
sexuality of individuals served as a fundamental basis for
power over life during the 17th and 18th centuries. A
plethora of information has been amassed in order to become
knowledgeable aboaut individuals’ private lives. Bio-politics
allows for the management and regulation of populations and
their common characteristics. Thus, the management of
demography (birth, mortality and fertility rates, longevity,
state of health, etc.) and of resources constitutes a determining stage in the regulation of human life (Smart 2002).
Social policies supervise populations to ensure their compliance with respect to the tasks and requirements faced by



the state (Hewitt 1983). According to Hewitt (1983), ‘social
policy plays a co-ordinating role in forming ‘the social’. It
promotes and organizes knowledge, norms and social practices to regulate the quality of life of the population – its
health, security and stability’ (p. 67). These same social
policies serve as the basis for the development of an expert
discourse that categorizes, classifies, distinguishes and excludes, all within the political, economic and administrative
spheres (Hewitt 1983). The success of these policies rests on
the fact that they penetrate each individual to the point where
they become their own: ‘through the new public health
discourses (among others), external imperatives are internalized as private interests. (…). The practice has become habit,
a practice of the self perpetuated not by the dictates of
external imperatives but by the individual’s habits of everyday life’ (Petersen & Lupton 1996, pp. 70–71).
Dreyfus and Rabinow (1982) accuse most notably the
human and medical sciences of hiding, behind the banner of
well-being and protection of individuals, the true intentions
of their actions. These consist of the implementation of a
network serving to disseminate the different forms of power
throughout the various segments of the population, including
the elaboration of norms that act as comparative elements for
the bodies and their categorization as normal or pathological.
Furthermore, these authors contend that the identification of
deviant bodies demonstrates the necessity of maintaining the
various institutions of power (religious, medical, judiciolegal, academic, etc.) and thereby justifying their raison
d’eˆtre: ‘We are promised normalisation and happiness
through science and law. When they fail, this only justifies
more of the same’ (Dreyfus & Rabinow 1982, p. 196).
However, where there is power there is also resistance. In
order to overcome this, individuals must be convinced that
what they are attempting to attain is in fact desirable (Saari
1999). Idealizing behaviours and opinions allows individuals
to manage themselves (Rose 1999): in the field of health,
nurses advocate the need to assume responsibility for one’s
own well-being through sound behaviour that ensures
longevity and a desired quality of life. They serve as guides
to these receptive individuals, while actually endorsing goals
desired by the state.
Knowledge accumulated by the state must be obtained
directly from diverse populations if it is to be used appropriately. To this end, the compiled data becomes statistical
information, irrefutable evidence of the level of performance
of a society (Foucault 2002b). Economic predictions, demographic projections, epidemiological data, market studies and
‘scientific’ research generate numbers that extract the ‘truth’
about a population and serve to justify current governmental
policies. They serve as anchor points for bio-political

A. Perron et al.


technologies that take on the semblance of solutions to
irregularities uncovered by censuses and surveys. According
to Garland (1997), ‘statistical information forms the basis for
political problematizations such as… the contemporary
concerns for our ageing population and its fiscal and social
consequences’ (p. 180). Statistics define the norm and
embody the current ideology. Consequently, even though
these data serve governmental objectives, they also affect the
population directly. Each person will seek to modify their
behaviour in order to ensure their place at the core of the
‘normal’ trend (Hacking 1986). Statistics produce ‘social
types’ that dictate the conception that individuals must have
of themselves (Hacking 1986). Queˆtelet, one of the most
influential social statisticians of the 19th century, established
through meticulous observations of physical and behavioural
characteristics, the first notion of ‘human normality’
(Halbwachs 1913). He was therefore able to isolate the traits
of the average man (sic), which eventually became the ‘ideal’
man which nature had attempted to create (Halbwachs
1913). Any deviation from this objective was considered an
error, an abnormal occurrence.
Foucault (2002a) and Goffman (1998) examined the
multiple forms of marginalization carried out to achieve the
transformation of individuals into a labour force (factories
and industrial plants), war machines (military barracks),
spiritual converts (convents) or subjects suitable to schooling
and education. Such training is accomplished within the
confines of institutions, which have their own established
routines, dress codes and jargon. Those who gain access to
the premises are isolated from the rest of society, sheltered
from all external influences that could encroach on the
process of transformation. However, they also undergo a
process of mortification, by which an individual’s personality
is ‘neutralized’ by admission protocols, the seizing of
personal effects and the degradation of the physical and
psychological self (Goffman 1998).
The next section aims to identify the presence of biopolitics within nursing practice and to determine the process
by which it incorporates itself through pastoral power, where
one person takes care of the other.


Nursing practice as an instrument of bio-politics


Primary nursing interventions, such as those dedicated to the
promotion of health and the prevention of diseases, are
arguably the best examples of the effects of bio-politics.
During an intervention, nurses accumulate an abundance of
information about the targeted populations who receive care.
Nurses convey information about behaviours that should be
adopted to preserve health, and they collect patients’ secrets



using surveys and evaluations or through various forms of
counselling. The promotion of health is accomplished at
many levels and through extensive awareness campaigns
aimed at informing the population of the risks presented by
their practices. These campaigns support healthy practices as
moral obligations (Petersen & Lupton 1996).
These interventions attempt to encourage citizens to take
responsibility for their health in order to achieve an optimal
level of health. When an entire population does this, it
functions at maximum capacity with nothing but benefits for
the state (Foucault 2002a). However, those who refuse to
adhere are labelled as non-compliant, and nurses are mandated to educate the population about healthy behaviour and
to pay particular attention to those who continue to resist
change.
Breastfeeding is another example of bio-political intervention. New mothers are subjected to great pressure in
hospitals, clinics and community centres to adopt breastfeeding exclusively for their infants (WHO/UNICEF 2000). The
benefits of breastfeeding have been well documented in
scientific writings and have been endorsed by a number of
authority figures such as Health Canada (1993) and the
World Health Organization (WHO/UNICEF 2000). However, while it is agreed that the final decision to breastfeed
belongs to mothers, the current health view strongly advocates that breastfeeding should replace all other forms of
feeding and even suggests that it is a mother’s duty to provide
for the best nutritional needs of the infant:


Breast milk is the most balanced food you can offer your infant! It


…allows mom and baby to begin a special relationship, and is


convenient and economical… The process is simple, natural, free and


safer for the environment! …Breastfeeding is more than simply


providing nutrients and calories for physical growth – it contributes


to a special closeness. So have confidence in nature and in yourself


and give your little one the very best start in life! (Health Canada


1993)


Some mothers still choose to use formula feeding, a choice
that is opposed to their maternal role – a role which Shaw
(2003) terms ’unconditional maternal generosity’ (p. 57).
This example illustrates how bio-politics allows for the
construction of individuals as moral and ethical beings as
their behaviours aim to serve both collective and individual
well-being.
Another illustration of the bio-political aspect, albeit based
on a more dramatic example, re-examines the forced sterilization of mentally ill and gognitively impaired people in the
middle of the 19th century. Park and Radford (1998) have
published a detailed study of laws established during this
period in North America: ‘such amendments mirrored

What is already known about this topic


 - Discussions of the concept of power mostly concentrate
on its repressive nature.

 - Traditional writings depict nursing as a powerless profession and an apolitical practice.

 - Poststructuralists have only been recently cited in nursing literature as they are generally perceived as
threatening.


What this paper adds


 - Reconciliation of nursing with poststructuralist perspectives and demonstration that they are not incompatible.

 - A challenge to the precept that nurses belong to a
powerless profession.

 - Identification of nursing as a political agency.


prevailing public and medical opinion in favour of the right of
the State to sterilize citizens diagnosed as ‘‘mentally ill’’ or
‘‘deficient’’ for the good of society’ (p. 318). It should be noted
that, although these laws have since been abolished, the
sterilization of mentally ill patients remains a current practice
when performed in to treat violent behaviour or prevent
pregnancy (Diekema 2003). In the 20th century, in the United
States, 30 states have legislated for the forced sterilization of
mentally ill people: ‘The justification for these laws relied
on the eugenic argument that society would be better off if
certain individuals were not able to reproduce’ (Diekema
2003, p. 22).
Finally, an extreme example of bio-political power operating within ‘total’ institutions is exemplified by the death
penalty still in force in numerous countries, including the US.
A worrying issue carefully concealed by American laws
(Holmes & Federman 2003) is the role played by healthcare
professionals, including nurses, in the carrying out of these
sentences. Such responsibilities include monitoring detainees
awaiting their sentences being carried out and administration
of the substances used to cause death. American states that
require the participation of healthcare personnel during the
execution, consider it necessary because of the status of the
latter as a provider of care (Holmes & Federman 2003).


Conclusion


In this paper, we have explored the conceptual richness
offered by bio-power and shown it is echoed in current
nursing practice. This approach might generate critiques



within nursing, as it diverges from nursing literature in which
nurses are portrayed as a powerless group. However, nurses
use various strategies aimed at shaping individual and
collective behaviours, and operate at a (strategic) crossroads
that involves government authorities and patients. They serve
as cogwheels within the healthcare apparatus. We believe
that this conceptual analysis of bio-power is useful for
nursing because it allows for the deconstruction of nursing as
an apolitical health care profession. Although we have paid
particular attention to its application within the practice of
nursing, it is relevant also in other human sciences well
beyond the field of health.
Understanding nursing through the perspective of biopower questions the taken for granted discourse that nurses
always act in the best interests of individuals. It automatically
places nurses in a position of authority (conferred as much by
expertise as by the mandate granted by the state), which is
contrary to the idea that patients should be autonomous in
their care. This assessment leads us to question ourselves
about the effects of nursing interventions. Beyond the
individual’s well-being, it seems that efforts to promote
optimal health also serve to forge a productive and normalized society. We suggest that the nursing profession is
profoundly political and that nurses, through the use of their
knowledge and conferred social mandate (care-giving) act as
agents of the state.
