Background: In LMICs, Community Health Workers (CHW) increasingly play health promotion related
roles involving ‘Empowerment of communities’. To be able to empower the communities they serve, we
argue, it is essential that CHWs themselves be, and feel, empowered. We present here a critique of how
diverse national CHW programs affect CHW's empowerment experience.
Methods: We present an analysis of findings from a systematic review of literature on CHW programs in
LMICs and 6 country case studies (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique). Lee &
Koh's analytical framework (4 dimensions of empowerment: meaningfulness, competence, selfdetermination and impact), is used.
Results: CHW programs empower CHWs by providing CHWs, access to privileged medical knowledge,
linking CHWs to the formal health system, and providing them an opportunity to do meaningful and
impactful work. However, these empowering influences are constantly frustrated by e the sense of lack/
absence of control over one's work environment, and the feelings of being unsupported, unappreciated,
and undervalued. CHWs expressed feelings of powerlessness, and frustrations about how organisational
processual and relational arrangements hindered them from achieving the desired impact.
Conclusions: While increasingly the onus is on CHWs and CHW programs to solve the problem of health
access, attention should be given to the experiences of CHWs themselves. CHW programs need to move
beyond an instrumentalist approach to CHWs, and take a developmental and empowerment perspective
when engaging with CHWs. CHW programs should systematically identify disempowering organisational arrangements and take steps to remedy these. Doing so will not only improve CHW performance,
it will pave the way for CHWs to meet their potential as agents of social change, beyond perhaps their
role as health promoters.

and some curative health services to communities while working in
partnership with other frontline health workers (Perry et al., 2014;
Global Health Workforce Alliance, 2010; Haines et al., 2007). This
becomes particularly relevant given the massive shortage of health
workers in LMICs, estimated by World Health Organisation at
around 4.25 million workers (World Health Organisation, 2006),
the inequitable distribution of health workers within countries, and
the need to accelerate progress in working towards universal health
coverage (UHC) and the achievement of the proposed sustainable
development goals for beyond 2015 (Open Working Group of the
General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals, 2014). According to Perry et al., (2014), more than 5 million CHWs are active
globally and recent reviews of evidence on the subject point to both
the effectiveness and importance of CHWs in providing services to
communities (Kok et al., 2014a; Gilmore and McAuliffe, 2013; Perry
and Zulliger, 2012).
Community health workers, in many countries, hail from
modest social, economic, educational backgrounds, and are often
women (De Koning et al., 2014; Maes et al., 2014; Bhatia, 2014). In
most LMICs CHWs are the lowest level cadre of health workers and
they constitute a diverse group of health workers who work primarily outside of health facilities, and close to the communities
they serve (Global Health Workforce Alliance, 2010; Kok et al.,
2014a; Perry and Zulliger, 2012). In LMIC settings, CHW provide a
wide range of services, ranging from provision of safe delivery,
counselling on breast-feeding, management of uncomplicated
childhood illnesses, health education and promotion on malaria,
TB, HIV/AIDs, STDs and NCDs, facilitating access to services, and at
places also supporting rehabilitation services (Global Health
Workforce Alliance, 2010; Kok et al., 2014a; Perry and Zulliger,
2012). Similarly CHWs' roles vary across countries - extension
worker, a health promotor and educator, a facilitator, community
mobiliser, first line care provider, and sometimes counsellor and
advisor. Irrespective of the LMIC context, a common feature is the
centrality of ‘health promotion’ related activities in CHW's work.
Labonte & Laverack (p 29) define health promotion as “an
empowering practice aimed at social change” (Labonte and [�]
Laverack, 2006). According to Rootman et al. (p 530), the core of
health promotion practice is “empowerment: enhancing capacities
of individuals and communities to exercise control over the determinants of health” (Rootman et al., 2001). Indeed, as the recent
systematic review of the global experience of CHWs shows,
‘empowerment of communities’ is a notion that is well established
in CHW policies and programs globally, and many, if not all CHW
programs have an explicit or implicit commitment to the
‘empowerment of beneficiary communities’ (Global Health
Workforce Alliance, 2010).
For CHWs to be able to function as health promotion practitioners, and to be able to empower the citizens and communities
they serve, we argue, it is essential that they themselves be, and
feel, empowered. Tulenko et al. (p 847) concur and contend that “In
moving towards UHC, much can be gained by investing in building
CHWs' skills and supporting them as valued members of the health
team” (Tulenko et al., 2013). Few have explored the subject of
empowerment of CHWs (Maes et al., 2015a, 2015b); this study aims
to contribute to this body of knowledge. We examine the
‘empowerment experience’ of CHWs as part of the REACHOUT
study which is being conducted in Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique,
Kenya, Bangladesh and Indonesia; we critically analyse what facilitates or hinders this experience.


2. Methodology


Two complementary perspectives have been used to study and
understand employee/worker empowerment: the social-structural



perspective and the psychological perspective. The ‘social-structural perspective’ emphasizes the importance of social, economic,
political and organizational structures and arrangements and how
they affect or condition the employee's state of empowerment (or
powerlessness). It refers to policies, practices and relations that
involve sharing decision-making power between managers and
workers (Liden and Arad, 1996; Eylon and Bamberger, 2005). In the
‘psychological perspective’ the emphasis is on employee's perceptions and experiences, on the employee's perceptions and beliefs of
power, competence, control and self-efficacy (Thomas and
Velthouse, 1990; Conger and Kanungo, 1998; Lee and Koh, 2001).
The psychological perspective thus builds on the social-structural
perspective and conceptualises the social-structural arrangements
as powers that shape the individual's experience of empowerment.
Lee and Koh, (2001), drawing upon Thomas and Velthouse, (1990)
original work, use this understanding as the basis to define
employee empowerment as “the psychological state of a subordinate perceiving four dimensions of meaningfulness, competence,
impact, and self-determination, which are affected by empowering
behaviours of the supervisor (and other structures)”.
According to them ‘meaningfulness’ refers to the meaning
ascribed to, or the value of a task goal or purpose, judged in relation
to an individual's own ideals or standards. ‘Competence’ is an individual's belief in his/her capability to perform activities skilfully.
‘Impact’ refers to the perception of the degree to which an individual thinks he/she can influence certain outcomes at work.
Thomas and Velthouse (1990) originally used the term ‘choice’ in
preference over ‘self-determination’ and this referred to whether a
person perceived his/her behaviour as being self-determined, and
of his/her own choice e we also choose to use the term ‘choice’ for
the purpose of this study. We do so with the understanding that the
locus of causality can be either invested in the person or be in the
external environment.
Using Lee and Koh’s (2001) conceptual framework we analyse
how program design and implementation processes, in different
LMIC contexts, facilitate or constrain the empowerment experience
of CHWs. Literature from organizational and management studies
shows the benefits of empowerment of workers to the organizations they work for and for workers themselves (Seibert et al., 2011;
Maynard et al., 2012; Aime et al., 2014). We reflect upon the limits
of and opportunities for improving CHW programs so that CHWs
are empowered, perform better, are enabled to serve and empower
their communities, better.
Our analysis is based on findings from Phase 1 of the five year
REACHOUT project which explores factors influencing the performance of CHWs globally, and in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia,
Kenya, Malawi and Mozambique, in particular. The REACHOUT
study scope is broader than just CHWs; as the study participants
are a wide range of care providers, all with one common characteristic e their proximity to the communities they serve. Phase 1 of
the REACHOUT project involved a review of the international
literature on the subject (150 studies and 46 reviews) (Kok et al.,
2014a), six reviews of country level literature on the subject in
the REACHOUT countries, and, six country level qualitative context
analysis that explored a range of CHW related issues. These literature reviews and qualitative studies were done over 2013e2014.
Phase 2 is currently ongoing and involves action research cycles to
test interventions developed based on findings from Phase 1.
Overall ethical approval was received from Ethics Committees at
KIT Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam; country level approvals
were received from Ethics Committees in each of the six study
countries.
Based on the reviews of literature, including of different
frameworks examining the performance of a variety of close to
community care providers, a common conceptual framework (Kok


S. Kane et al. / Social Science & Medicine 164 (2016) 27e34 29



et al., 2014a) was developed to guide the six country level qualitative context analyses. The framework formed the basis of common topic guides for in-depth interviews and focus group
discussions (FGDs); it provided a shared frame for the six country
teams to explore factors that enabled or hindered the performance
of CHWs. Together the six country level qualitative context analysis
involved 250 interviews and 65 FGDs; hereafter we collectively
refer to these as REACHOUT country case studies (Gani et al., 2014;
Mireku et al., 2014; Nasir et al., 2014; Nyirenda et al., 2014; Sidat
et al., 2014; Zerihun et al., 2014). The respondents, across the six
study countries, included: CHWs, CHW supervisors, healthcare
service managers, formal care providers, citizens e men and
women. Details of sampling and recruitment are summarised in
Table 1 and are presented in detail in the six REACHOUT country
case study reports.
The data gathered during Phase 1 was interrogated from a variety of perspectives, including, as is the case in this paper, a human
resource management and worker empowerment perspective. For
this paper, we initially analysed the six country case study reports;
to further clarify and elucidate the themes that emerged from this
initial analysis, we ran queries on the primary data (in the NVivo 10
files).


3. Findings


This section presents an analysis of how, in the six REACHOUT
study countries, program design choices and implementation
processes, facilitated or constrained CHW's experience of the four
dimensions of employee empowerment: meaningfulness, competence, choice and impact.


4. CHWs views on the ‘meaningfulness’ of their work


‘Meaningfulness’ refers to the meaning ascribed to or the value

of a task goal or purpose judged in relation to an individual's own
ideals or standards. This refers to a congruence between the work,
the role and an individual's beliefs, values and behaviors. Both, the
literature (Gilmore and McAuliffe, 2013; Perry and Zulliger, 2012;
Pallas et al., 2013; Kane et al., 2010; Druetz et al., 2015; CHW
Technical Task Force, 2015; Callaghan-Koru et al., 2012) and the
six REACHOUT country case studies (Gani et al., 2014; Mireku et al.,
2014; Nasir et al., 2014; Nyirenda et al., 2014; Sidat et al., 2014;
Zerihun et al., 2014) point out that some form of meaning in their
work is a dominant source of feelings of empowerment for CHWs
across the world. What is ‘meaningful’, and what makes it ‘meaningful’ is derived from of a variety of things e and relates to a
combination of the nature of work that CHWs do, the roles that
they are now ascribed, the tasks that their society privileges, past
personal experiences, and religion.
As the following quotes from CHWs in Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi,
illustrate, CHWs feel empowered as a result of them being viewed
and identified by their communities, as being associated with the
formal medical and health system, a highly privileged professional
system in these countries, and generally across the world.


“If you're a midwife, it looks good. I like seeing people using white
clothes. It's nice, cool …” (Indonesia Case Study e Community
Midwife)


“It motivates you … even the households will see you and say “my
doctor is here” they start calling you doctor” (Kenya Case Study CHW)


“… the uniforms we wear are our identity. People in the village or at
the clinic identify us easily because of the uniform … “(Malawi
Case Study - CHW)


Similarly, being able to serve their communities, in times of their
need and being appreciated for it, was something that CHWs

attached great importance and meaning to; as the quotes from
Kenya and Indonesia illustrate, being a CHW - the tasks and roles it
entails, allows them to fulfil their dreams, and their ‘calling’.:


“[I] saw that it was a ‘calling’ and I accepted and I was once helped
and I want to return the favor” (Kenya Case Study - CHW)


“Since in primary school I always have a dream to help people. So I
became a midwife. I like to serve the people around me.”
(Indonesia Case Study e Village Midwife)


For many CHWs, the opportunity to make a difference to the
lives of their people, including through saving lives, the gratitude
they receive for doing so, and being trusted, gives value and
meaning to their work - makes their work, as this CHW from
Ethiopia says, “great”.


“When I see the result I feel happy, and the community also thanks
us after we saved their life: health extension workers are doing a
great job. Health extension work is great …. ” (Ethiopia Case Study

  - CHW)


“From my job, I feel happy by attending delivery. They trust us and
we are attending delivery at day as well as night. In addition, they
are using vaccination; they are giving birth with space.” (Ethiopia
Case Study - CHW)


For some, working as a CHW allows opportunities to channel
their values and beliefs into concrete actions. For many, as these
CHWs from Mozambique and Bangladesh say, this work allows
them to achieve in its fullness, what Lee and Koh (2001) define as
meaningfulness “congruence between the requirements of a work
role and an individual's beliefs, values and behaviours”.


“.. it is our duty to motivate a newly married girl to take a method
(family planning) and show the right path …” (Bangladesh Case
Study - CHW)


“Working for health is equal to a pastor who works for God, works
for the people and for God, is a complete work …. It is not because of
the money that people go to work in health.” (Mozambique Case
Study e CHW)


These findings mirror our experiences in this field generally;
that for most CHWs, the work they do also carries a deeper
meaning; for many it is an opportunity for self-actualization, for
some a means to reify their faith and humanity, and for others a
means to even define their identities.


5. The power of newly gained ‘competence’


Competence refers to an individual's belief in his/her capability
to perform task activities skilfully (Lee and Koh, 2001). This refers to
agency, beliefs, personal enactive mastery of tasks or self-efficacy
(Lee and Koh, 2001). Our analysis of the literature revealed that
almost all CHW program designs involve competence-based
training of CHWs on specific tasks targeted at specific situations,
supplemented by practice sessions and on-job mentoring (Kok
et al., 2014a; De Koning et al., 2014; Kane et al., 2010; Kok et al.,
2014b). The literature shows that CHWs universally value these,
and often express desires to gain more knowledge and skills (Kok
et al., 2014a; De Koning et al., 2014; Kane et al., 2010; Kok et al.,
2014b). This, as illustrated by the quotes below, together with the
difference that CHWS can make in wielding this knowledge and
skills, and the consequent meaning it adds to their lives, makes
these newly gained competencies an important driver of the



empowerment experience for the CHWs.


“This [training] has really helped [me make] my community be
healthy and free of disease” (Kenya Case Study - CHW)


“It would be good to give us more training courses and increase the
medicines. Giving us new skills to treat other diseases, because
there are things that is missing here in the community …”
(Mozambique Case Study e CHW)


In our analysis we recognised Kane et al’s. (2010) conclusions on
the matter - the knowledge based training aspects of CHW programmes provide access to new, specialised, and socially privileged
knowledge, and thereby trigger a sense of self-efficacy amongst
CHWs.These findings are also consistent with recent empirical
work by Nandi and Schneider (2014), Bhatia (2014), (Ingram et al.,
2008), and Becker et al. (2004). It is however worth noting that the
knowledge and competence that CHWs value the most tend to be
related to curative tasks. The next section also shows how it is
through the application of curative knowledge and competencies
CHWs are able to see a clear impact of their work, and feel
empowered.


6. Clear and present ‘impact’ of their work


Impact refers to the perceptions of the degree to which an individual can influence strategic, administrative or operating outcomes at work (Lee and Koh, 2001). The literature consistently
points out that CHWs across the board believe that they make a
major impact on the lives of the people in their communities,
through helping protect the health of their people, through supporting their people to make right and healthy decisions, and
through saving lives, (Kok et al., 2014a; Perry and Zulliger, 2012;
Pallas et al., 2013; Kane et al., 2010; Druetz et al., 2015).
As the following quotes highlight, being able to serve their
people in their time of need, and particularly being able to help save
lives, gives CHWs a sense of doing impactful work.


“The most interesting thing is saving the life of women and children. I feel happy when one mother calls me at her delivery. Previously, I was attending delivery at their home, now I am attending
in the health post since the bed is available …. ” (Ethiopia Case
Study - CHW)


“The village clinics are also helping children a lot, when the get sick,
they easily access drugs and we have helped in saving a number of
lives for these children.” (Kenya Case Study e CHW)


“I do work with Mai Khanda in so many programs. For example, the
safe motherhood programme … this group do some follow ups on
pregnant women. To ensure that pregnant women attend antenatal
and that pregnant women give birth at the hospital to save the life
of the mother and the baby.” (Malawi Case Study e CHW)


Some CHWs saw themselves as making an impact in terms of
being able to guide their people to make the right decisions
through sharing their newly acquired knowledge; others, as the
quote from a CHW in Malawi illustrates, saw the impact of their
work at an even higher level e as a contribution to building a
healthier, better society.


“I feel happy because, first, I have so many friends, so much
knowledge. … I didn't know about immunization, I didn't know
about BCG. Now, I know about that … I have more knowledge, so I
share my experience with friends, give them advice …” (Indonesia
Case Study e Village Midwife)


S. Kane et al. / Social Science & Medicine 164 (2016) 27e34 31



“The work of an HSA has been my desired job … I was interested to
help the children who are being born, the expectant mothers, all the
women and the under-five to have a healthy life. We have to give
the services to these people, because they are the leaders of
tomorrow. If these people cannot have better services then this
country will not be good in future” (Malawi Case Study - CHW)


We found that the CHWs feel able to influence operational level
outcomes at work; outcomes related to activities like sharing
knowledge, giving advice and helping people gain access to health
services. We did not find any instances of them being able to influence strategic level outcomes at work e for example, instances of
contributing to identifying local needs, or setting local service
priorities, or influencing resource allocation and planning. This
however did not hinder the empowerment experience of the
CHWs, probably because of both, as this section shows, them
themselves imagining the difference they make, and also perhaps
them accepting the constraints set by the program design and
implementation processes on the difference they can make. Thus,
this sense of empowerment, one might argue, is in many ways both
because of and inspite of CHW program design and implementation processes. This is highlighted further in the next section which
shows how the managerial imperatives constrain CHWs ability to
exercise ‘choice’.


7. The perceptions of ‘choice’


The fourth dimension of the cognitive construct of employee
empowerment is ‘choice’. It refers to perceptions of autonomy in
the initiation and continuation of work behaviours and processes;
it refers to whether a person perceives his/her behaviour as being
self-determined. The point being that perceiving oneself as the
locus of causality for one's behaviour (as the originator, rather than
the pawn) is essential for intrinsic motivation (Thomas and
Velthouse, 1990), and thereby for feeling empowered. CHWs
consistently express feelings of helplessness, feelings of being
undervalued and not having control in their work sphere. This
paucity of control and its erosive effects on their sense of self-worth
and self-esteem is a recurring underlying theme; although, and
expectedly, there are variations depending upon the program designs and the decision space it offers to CHWs. The findings below
illustrate how programs by not providing good and timely support
and resources (not necessarily deliberately) and authority to CHWs,
undermine their empowerment experience.
For instance, CHWs in Indonesia expressed feelings of powerlessness and helplessness about program implementation processes that hindered their work.


“When I participated in the asphyxia training, I wanted to
disseminate it to village midwives, but we don't have Ambu bag

[breathing aids] up until now. So when I wanted to disseminate it, I
didn't have any related materials, which made it useless.”
(Indonesia Case Study e Village Midwife)


“Many pregnant mothers like to come to Posyandu because they
want have their blood pressure measured or they want to listen to
baby's heart rate. They really like these, but not all village midwives
have these instrument. Or some of them have but then broken and
cannot immediately replaced” (Indonesia Case Study e Community Midwife)


Clearly flawed program design features, for example inadequate
and rushed trainings which did not take into account the learning
needs of the CHWs in Malawi, accentuated their sense of



inadequacy, were a source of frustration, and were disempowering.


“The other thing is about trainings, things that you are supposed to
learn for two or three weeks they teach us for three days only, so it
becomes very difficult to apply them when we are in the community we fail as we don't know where to start from.” (Malawi Case
Study e Health Surveillance Assistant)


Management failures around the timely payment of allowances,
particularly when compared to how well things worked for other
cadres, were a source of feelings of being undervalued and of not
having control in their work sphere; a CHW in Mozambique tellingly expressed his frustrations:


“When I was chosen as APE they spoke about the monthly allowance and I hoped that allowance was monthly … this is my 4th
month and I have not received … is just not enough for anything .. I
have my wife, two sons and my mother is elderly .. and I have to
support my family” (Mozambique Case Study e APE)


Similarly, management apathy around allowances for CHWs, as
the CHW from Kenya points out, are also a source of feelings of
being undervalued and of not having control over one's work
sphere.


“And even when you're a senior HSA you receive a salary which is
the same with any HSA. For example our senior HSA started
working as an HSA in 1993 while I started working as HSA in 2007
but we receive the same salary. This demotivates us and makes us
not work extra hard” (Malawi Case Study e Health Surveillance
Assistant)


In all the six country case studies e CHWs indicated that very
often the supervision processes were too focused on reporting data
and fault finding. CHWs reported various ways in which this
undermined their morale and sense of self-worth.


“What makes us not work hard is, when the higher health office
comes for supervision, they leave our strong parts and take very
minor things and discourage us …. ”. (Ethiopia Case Study e
Health Extension Worker)


“The downside of maternal and child health revolution in this
province is we (midwives) are always blamed, especially when a
mother died. What we want actually is a more support like trainings and instruments so we can work better” (Indonesia Case
Study e Community Midwife)


On being explicitly asked about the control they have over their
own work, and decision making, a CHW in Malawi responded,


“I don't have such influence … We here are juniors, when we are
voicing our concerns on what needs to be done to create a
conducive working environment, it is referred to as insubordination”. (Malawi Case Study e Health Surveillance Assistant)


Similarly, in Kenya on being asked whether they would like their
roles to be expanded, CHWs in a FGD expressed how expanding
their roles and decision space would empower them and would
help to improve their performance.


“Yeah they should … they should empower us to be able to nurse
them before reaching the (hospital) to avoid women deaths during
giving birth” (Kenya Case Study - CHW).

8. Discussion and conclusions


In this paper we have critically analysed the international
literature and the six REACHOUT study country context analysis
findings with a view to understand the empowerment experience
of the CHWs. While this explicit focus on examining the ‘empowerment experience’ of CHWs who are meant to ‘empower’ the
communities they serve, is an under researched area within the
field of health services research in LMICs, its importance has been
recognized before (Maes et al., 2015a, 2015b).
In 2003, Shrestha from Nepal presented a conceptual model for
the empowerment of CHWs (FCHVs - female community health
volunteers), and argued that only when FCHVs are empowered
themselves, can they bring sustainable change and improve the
health outcomes of the communities they serve (Shrestha, 2003).
That empowerment of CHWs is an essential prelude to them being
effective in enacting their roles as health promoters, has also been
highlighted, in different parts of the world. In the ASHA Plus project
(ITAP - IFPS Technical Assistance Project, 2012) in India, CHWs
explicitly reported being empowered as a result of access to new
knowledge, new freedoms, and new opportunities. Bhatia (2014)
also discusses the contradictions and tensions inherent in the
CHW program designs and management; she highlights how the
empowering influence of access to new knowledge, meaningful
and socially relevant work on one hand, is often at odds with the
managerial imperative to maintain control and contain costs on the
other hand. Similarly, Campbell et al. (2009), drawing on their
experience in South Africa, contend that the process of challenging
entrenched structural power inequalities, within organisations,
across professional boundaries, is essential, but bound to be messy.
They argue that meeting of the ‘empowerment objectives’ of such
initiatives, both the empowerment of CHWs and the communities
they serve and seek to empower, while necessarily slow and
gradual, is an essential precondition to achieving change. Mc Creary
et al. (2013) also report how voluntary peer group leaders identified
the experience of being empowered, as central to their development of an identity and to be effective as peer and community
health promoters.
Methodologically, while Lee and Koh's framework (Lee and Koh,
2001) helped us unpack the different dimensions of the CHWs'
empowerment experience, it fell short in guiding us in explaining
the antecedents of the four dimensions. The framework was
perhaps originally designed to examine the situation of workers
who had clearly defined profiles, clear identities, were formally
employed and paid, and operated in well-defined relational environments. These reference points do not consistently apply to all
CHW program contexts and this sometimes hindered the use of the
framework to examine the situation of CHWs within different
contexts. Along the same lines, in some ways the framework assumes that, once empowered, employees would want to stay on in
the organizations they work in. It does not take into account the
possibility that an empowered worker might have higher expectations and is more likely to leave if service conditions do not meet
these new expectations (expectations about role or compensation
or conditions generally).
In 2012, Maynard, Gilson and Mathieu, in their review of the
past two decades of research on empowerment within organizational settings, have articulated the importance of researching
empowerment from a multilevel perspective (Maynard et al., 2012).
They distinguish between a hierarchy of organizational, team and
individual empowerment, and their antecedents. They indicate that
research should examine different or multiple levels and the influence that higher levels have on individual psychological
empowerment. They also identify the importance for research to
explore and expose, sometimes competing mediators of individual



psychological empowerment. In this paper, we have focused on the
individual level psychological empowerment experience of the
CHWs e and we have considered the program design, organizational arrangements, relational features, and their interactions, as
being antecedents that shape the individual/CHW level psychological empowerment experience. We interpret these as multiple
levels of antecedents determining the four dimensions of Lee and
Koh (2001) empowerment experience. Maynard, Gilson and
Mathieu (Maynard et al., 2012) further argue that while researchers
too often, and understandably, collapse the dimensions of individual level psychological empowerment (choice, competence,
meaningfulness and impact) into a composite measure, it would be
better if these dimensions are analysed using an interactional
approach. In this paper, we have attempted to do this e a limitation
of our effort however is the fact that the REACHOUT study looked at
a wide range of issues affecting CHW's performance, and our data
collection tools were not always explicitly oriented to uncover the
empowerment experience of CHWs. In addition, and in retrospect,
we could have organised our sampling strategy differently. For
example, had we stratified our informants by characteristics that
could influence their empowerment experience, such as, years in
service, age, gender, or common tasks (curative vs promotive vs
linkage), we would have been able to get a better understanding of
the antecedents of the empowerment experience.
In their recent work, Maes et al. (2015a) make a compelling case
for researchers and development practitioners to take a critical
view on the gendered political economy of CHW programs; they
argue that it is important to unpack the multiple simultaneous
narratives at play, and to go beyond the simplistic narratives about
CHW's provision of health services. They urge researchers to
analyse the claims and narratives of empowerment (and participation), taking due cognizance of existing political, historical and
relational context (Maes et al., 2015b). This paper, while it does not
cover the whole distance, does cover in detail how the organizational and relational contexts shape CHW's empowerment. Our
data does not allow us to comment on the broader socio-politicaleconomic contexts shaping the empowerment potential of community health workers, hence the omission. We have however
illustrated how organisational arrangements within CHW programs in LMICs both facilitate and frustrate the CHWs empowerment experience, and argued for the need for CHW programs to be
reoriented to enhance the empowerment experience of CHWs.
Worker empowerment and its operationalization is a much studied
and contested subject in organizational studies (Maynard et al.,
2012). While there are those who see it as key to the well-being
of all parties, others argue that empowerment initiatives within
organizations are always designed to achieve managerial goals e
conflict containment, productivity gains, and to maintain the power balance between the employees and the employers (Argyris,
1998; Hardy and O'Sullivan, 1998). Some argue, echoing the Foucaultian understanding of the concept of governmentality
(Foucault, 1991), that the worker empowerment project is but
merely an insidious form of managerialism operating through
considered and calculated modes of managerial action intended to
structure and subject the actions of others e just another forms of
subjugation of the worker. Their point being that organisational
claims notwithstanding, employee empowerment initiatives are
always at odds with managerial imperatives and interests; and that
this would be so for the CHWs too. This is echoed to some extent in
the REACHOUT country case studies; CHWs and other similar
cadres are often left to their own devices, are rarely visited by supervisors and have little decision space to construct approaches
that would allow them to better respond to the needs of the
communities they serve.
We however agree with Hardy and O'Sullivan (1998) that while


S. Kane et al. / Social Science & Medicine 164 (2016) 27e34 33



there might be some point to these arguments, one misses the
point if one generalizes them. And that empowerment initiatives
may improve the quality of the work environment for the workers.
We believe that this is probably more so the situation in the case of
CHWs and CHW programs in LMICs. This is because of the unique
situation of CHWs in most LMICs e of them being not the usual
worker within health systems, them being at the interface of the
health system and the communities, and their role as community
based, and not facility based health workers, all of which fundamentally limits the control that their managers can exercise on
them. Even from a purely organizational and operational perspective, the limitations of the technologies of supervision and control
inherent to the delivery of community-based services, necessitates
a partnership approach towards CHW cadres. We argue that CHW
programs can perform better if they systematically partner with
and empower CHWs; any managerial attempts at control along the
same lines as controlling other health worker cadres can only occur
at the expense of frustrating an important purpose of CHW programs e community-based health promotion and contribution to
social change. Swift and Levin (1987) have convincingly argued that
there is nothing in the psychological definition of empowerment
that requires the increase of power of one group to decrease the
power of another group, and that power does not have to be seen as
a zero-sum commodity, but can be a 'win-win' situation e we argue
that in the case of CHWs in the LMIC health systems, this is the case.
One must however recognize that the healthcare profession is
highly hierarchical, with often rigidly defined roles and the privileges that go with these roles. We appreciate that initiative to increase the scope of work of a new group, like CHWs, particularly to
include curative tasks, will expectedly be contested and will face
resistance, for various reasons, from various existing cadres within
the system. Furthermore, evidence on the shifting of curative tasks
to CHWs warns of the problems of misdiagnosis, delays, and
inappropriate disease management; evidence shows that shifting
of curative tasks to CHWs should only be done within the context of
well-functioning health system, and should be limited to few tasks
(World Health Organisation, 2008; Fulton et al., 2011). We
acknowledge this evidence; our call for creating an empowering
work environment of CHWs should thus not be seen as a call for
indiscriminately expanding the scope of curative tasks of CHWs
(tasks which CHWs expectedly find very empowering). Perhaps, as
the recent review by Naimoli et al. (2015) highlights, helping CHWs
and communities to better appreciate the importance of the noncurative tasks and the critical role they play as the bridge between communities and the health system, through clear inclusion
of these messages in the CHW training curriculum, and its regular
reiteration by other cadres, could be a way forward.
We contend that CHW programs in LMICs already have many
elements that offer an empowering experience to CHWs through
improving competence, enhancing self-esteem, offering opportunities for meaningful and socially impactful work. We argue that
while this is good, these empowerment influences fall short in
translating into CHW's performance whenever and wherever they
are undermined by organizational arrangements and relations that
trigger cognitions of being helpless, undervalued and not in control,
amongst CHWs. We contend the latter need not be the case; that
CHW programs would benefit from systematically interrogating
their program design and implementation to identify disempowering organizational and management arrangements, both
relational and processual, and to take steps to remedy these. Doing
so would not only improve CHW program performance, it would
also pave the way for CHWs to meet their potential as agents of
social change, beyond their role as links between the community
and the health system.
