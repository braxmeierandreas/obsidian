Domain 1: Risk of bias arising from the randomization process





|Signalling questions|Elaboration|Response options|
|---|---|---|
|~~**1.1 Was the allocation**~~<br>**sequence random?**<br>|~~Answer ‘Yes’ if a random component was used in the sequence generation process. Examples include~~<br>computer-generated random numbers; reference to a random number table; coin tossing; shuffling cards<br>or envelopes; throwing dice; or drawing lots. Minimization is generally implemented with a random<br>element (at least when the scores are equal), so an allocation sequence that is generated using<br>minimization should generally be considered to be random.<br>Answer ‘No’ if no random element was used in generating the allocation sequence or the sequence is<br>predictable. Examples include alternation; methods based on dates (of birth or admission); patient<br>record numbers; allocation decisions made by clinicians or participants; allocation based on the<br>availability of the intervention; or any other systematic or haphazard method.<br>Answer ‘No information’ if the only information about randomization methods is a statement that the<br>study is randomized.<br>In some situations a judgement may be made to answer ‘Probably no’ or ‘Probably yes’. For example,, in<br>the context of a large trial run by an experienced clinical trials unit, absence of specific information about<br>generation of the randomization sequence, in a paper published in a journal with rigorously enforced word<br>count limits, is likely to result in a response of ‘Probably yes’ rather than ‘No information’. Alternatively, if<br>other (contemporary) trials by the same investigator team have clearly used non-random sequences, it<br>might be reasonable to assume that the current study was done using similar methods.<br>|~~Y/PY/PN/N/NI~~<br>|
|~~**1.2 Was the allocation**~~<br>**sequence concealed until**<br>**participants were**<br>**enrolled and assigned to**<br>**interventions?**|~~Answer ‘Yes’ if the trial used any form of remote or centrally administered method to allocate~~<br>interventions to participants, where the process of allocation is controlled by an external unit or<br>organization, independent of the enrolment personnel (e.g. independent central pharmacy, telephone or<br>internet-based randomization service providers).<br>Answer ‘Yes’ if envelopes or drug containers were used appropriately. Envelopes should be opaque,<br>sequentially numbered, sealed with a tamper-proof seal and opened only after the envelope has been<br>irreversibly assigned to the participant. Drug containers should be sequentially numbered and of<br>identical appearance, and dispensed or administered only after they have been irreversibly assigned to<br>the participant. This level of detail is rarely provided in reports, and a judgement may be required to<br>justify an answer of ‘Probably yes’ or ‘Probably no’.<br>Answer ‘No’ if there is reason to suspect that the enrolling investigator or the participant had knowledge<br>of the forthcoming allocation.|~~Y/PY/PN/N/NI~~|

|1.3 Did baseline<br>differences between<br>intervention groups<br>suggest a problem with<br>the randomization<br>process?|Note that differences that are compatible with chance do not lead to a risk of bias. A small number of<br>differences identified as ‘statistically significant’ at the conventional 0.05 threshold should usually be<br>considered to be compatible with chance.<br>Answer ‘No’ if no imbalances are apparent or if any observed imbalances are compatible with chance.<br>Answer ‘Yes’ if there are imbalances that indicate problems with the randomization process, including:<br>(1) substantial differences between intervention group sizes, compared with the intended allocation<br>ratio;<br>or<br>(2) a substantial excess in statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between<br>intervention groups, beyond that expected by chance; or<br>(3) imbalance in one or more key prognostic factors, or baseline measures of outcome variables,<br>that is very unlikely to be due to chance and for which the between-group difference is big<br>enough to result in bias in the intervention effect estimate.<br>Also answer ‘Yes’ if there are other reasons to suspect that the randomization process was problematic:<br>(4) excessive similarity in baseline characteristics that is not compatible with chance.<br>Answer ‘No information’ when there is no useful baseline information available (e.g. abstracts, or studies<br>that reported only baseline characteristics of participants in the final analysis).<br>The answer to this question should not influence answers to questions 1.1 or 1.2. For example, if the trial<br>has large baseline imbalances, but authors report adequate randomization methods, questions 1.1 and<br>1.2 should still be answered on the basis of the reported adequate methods, and any concerns about the<br>imbalance should be raised in the answer to the question 1.3 and reflected in the domain-level risk-of-<br>bias judgement.<br>Trialists may undertake analyses that attempt to deal with flawed randomization by controlling for<br>imbalances in prognostic factors at baseline. To remove the risk of bias caused by problems in the<br>randomization process, it would be necessary to know, and measure, all the prognostic factors that were<br>imbalanced at baseline. It is unlikely that all important prognostic factors are known and measured, so<br>such analyses will at best reduce the risk of bias. If review authors wish to assess the risk of bias in a trial<br>that controlled for baseline imbalances in order to mitigate failures of randomization, the study should<br>be assessed using the ROBINS-I tool.|Y/PY/PN/N/NI|

Domain 2: Risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions ( _effect of assignment to intervention_ )

Blinding may prevent such differences. If participants experienced side effects or toxicities that<br>carers or people delivering the interventions knew to be specific to one of the interventions, answer<br>question ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’. If randomized allocation was not concealed, then it is likely that carers<br>and people delivering the interventions were aware of participants' assigned intervention during the<br>trial.|~~Y/PY/PN/N/NI~~|

|2.3. If Y/PY/NI to 2.1 or<br>2.2: Were there<br>deviations from the<br>intended intervention<br>that arose because of the<br>trial context?|For the effect of assignment to intervention, this domain assesses problems that arise when changes from<br>assigned intervention that are inconsistent with the trial protocol arose because of the trial context. We<br>use the term trial context to refer to effects of recruitment and engagement activities on trial participants<br>and when trial personnel (carers or people delivering the interventions) undermine the implementation of<br>the trial protocol in ways that would not happen outside the trial. For example, the process of securing<br>informed consent may lead participants subsequently assigned to the comparator group to feel unlucky<br>and therefore seek the experimental intervention, or other interventions that improve their prognosis.<br>Answer ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’ only if there is evidence, or strong reason to believe, that the trial context<br>led to failure to implement the protocol interventions or to implementation of interventions not allowed<br>by the protocol.<br>Answer ‘No’ or ‘Probably no’ if there were changes from assigned intervention that are inconsistent with<br>the trial protocol, such as non-adherence to intervention, but these are consistent with what could occur<br>outside the trial context.<br>Answer ‘No’ or ‘Probably no’ for changes to intervention that are consistent with the trial protocol, for<br>example cessation of a drug intervention because of acute toxicity or use of additional interventions whose<br>aim is to treat consequences of one of the intended interventions.<br>If blinding is compromised because participants report side effects or toxicities that are specific to one of<br>the interventions, answer ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’ only if there were changes from assigned intervention<br>that are inconsistent with the trial protocol and arose because of the trial context.<br>The answer ‘No information’ may be appropriate, because trialists do not always report whether<br>deviations arose because of the trial context.|NA/Y/PY/PN/N/NI|

|2.5. If Y/PY/NI to 2.4:<br>Were these deviations<br>from intended<br>intervention balanced<br>between groups?|Changes from assigned intervention that are inconsistent with the trial protocol and arose because of the<br>trial context are more likely to impact on the intervention effect estimate if they are not balanced<br>between the intervention groups.|NA/Y/PY/PN/N/NI|
|---|---|---|
|~~**2.6 Was an appropriate**~~<br>**analysis used to estimate**<br>**the effect of assignment**<br>**to intervention?**<br>|~~Both intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses and modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analyses excluding~~<br>participants with missing outcome data should be considered appropriate. Both naïve ‘per-protocol’<br>analyses (excluding trial participants who did not receive their assigned intervention) and ‘as treated’<br>analyses (in which trial participants are grouped according to the intervention that they received, rather<br>than according to their assigned intervention) should be considered inappropriate. Analyses excluding<br>eligible trial participants post-randomization should also be considered inappropriate, but post-<br>randomization exclusions of ineligible participants (when eligibility was not confirmed until after<br>randomization, and could not have been influenced by intervention group assignment) can be<br>considered appropriate.<br>|~~Y/PY/PN/N/NI~~<br>|

It is not possible to specify a precise rule: there may be potential for substantial<br>impact even if fewer than 5% of participants were analysed in the wrong group or excluded, if the<br>outcome is rare or if exclusions are strongly related to prognostic factors.<br>|~~NA/Y/PY/PN/N/NI ~~<br>|

However, it is possible to use data from a randomized trial to derive an unbiased<br>estimate of the effect of adhering to intervention. Examples of appropriate methods include: (1)<br>instrumental variable analyses to estimate the effect of receiving the assigned intervention in trials in<br>which a single intervention, administered only at baseline and with all-or-nothing adherence, is compared<br>with standard care; and (2) inverse probability weighting to adjust for censoring of participants who cease<br>adherence to their assigned intervention, in trials of sustained treatment strategies. These methods<br>depend on strong assumptions, which should be appropriate and justified if the answer to this question is<br>‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’. It is possible that a paper reports an analysis based on such methods without<br>reporting information on the deviations from intended intervention, but it would be hard to judge such an<br>analysis to be appropriate in the absence of such information.<br>If an important non-protocol intervention was administered to all participants in one intervention group,<br>adjustments cannot be made to overcome this.<br>Some examples of analysis strategies that would not be appropriate to estimate the effect of adhering to<br>intervention are (i) ‘Intention to treat (ITT) analysis’, (ii) ‘per protocol analysis’, (iii) ‘as-treated analysis’,<br>(iv) ‘analysis by treatment received’.|NA/Y/PY/PN/N/NI|

Domain 3: Risk of bias due to missing outcome data





|Signalling questions|Elaboration|Response options|
|---|---|---|
|~~**3.1 Were data for this**~~<br>**outcome available for all,**<br>**or nearly all, participants**<br>**randomized?**<br>|~~The appropriate study population for an analysis of the intention to treat effect is all randomized~~<br>participants.<br>“Nearly all” should be interpreted as that the number of participants with missing outcome data is<br>sufficiently small that their outcomes, whatever they were, could have made no important difference to<br>the estimated effect of intervention.<br>For continuous outcomes, availability of data from 95% of the participants will often be sufficient. For<br>dichotomous outcomes, the proportion required is directly linked to the risk of the event. If the observed<br>number of events is much greater than the number of participants with missing outcome data, the bias<br>would necessarily be small.<br>Only answer ‘No information’ if the trial report provides no information about the extent of missing<br>outcome data. This situation will usually lead to a judgement that there is a high risk of bias due to missing<br>outcome data.<br>Note that imputed data should be regarded as missing data, and not considered as ‘outcome data’ in<br>the context of this question.<br>|~~Y/PY/PN/N/NI~~<br>|
|~~**3.2IfN/PN/NI to 3.1: Is**~~<br>**there evidence that the**<br>**result was not biased by**<br>**missing outcome data?**<br>|<br>~~Evidence that the result was not biased by missing outcome data may come from: (1) analysis methods~~<br>that correct for bias; or (2) sensitivity analyses showing that results are little changed under a range of<br>plausible assumptions about the relationship between missingness in the outcome and its true value.<br>However, imputing the outcome variable, either through methods such as ‘last-observation-carried-<br>forward’ or via multiple imputation based only on intervention group, should not be assumed to correct<br>for bias due to missing outcome data.<br>|~~NA/Y/PY/PN/N ~~<br>|
|~~**3.3IfN/PNto 3.2: Could**~~<br>**missingness in the**<br>**outcome depend on its**<br>**true value?**|~~If loss to follow up, or withdrawal from the study, could be related to participants’ health status, then it~~<br>is possible that missingness in the outcome was influenced by its true value. However, if all missing<br>outcome data occurred for documented reasons that are unrelated to the outcome then the risk of bias<br>due to missing outcome data will be low (for example, failure of a measuring device or interruptions to<br>routine data collection).<br>In time-to-event analyses, participants censored during trial follow-up, for example because they<br>withdrew from the study, should be regarded as having missing outcome data, even though some of their<br>follow up is included in the analysis. Note that such participants may be shown as included in analyses in<br>CONSORT flow diagrams.|~~NA/Y/PY/PN/N/NI ~~|

|3.4 If Y/PY/NI to 3.3: Is it<br>likely that missingness in<br>the outcome depended on<br>its true value?|This question distinguishes between situations in which (i) missingness in the outcome could depend on<br>its true value (assessed as ‘Some concerns’) from those in which (ii) it is likely that missingness in the<br>outcome depended on its true value (assessed as ‘High risk of bias’). Five reasons for answering ‘Yes’ are:<br>1. Differences between intervention groups in the proportions of missing outcome data. If there is a<br>difference between the effects of the experimental and comparator interventions on the outcome,<br>and the missingness in the outcome is influenced by its true value, then the proportions of missing<br>outcome data are likely to differ between intervention groups. Such a difference suggests a risk of<br>bias due to missing outcome data, because the trial result will be sensitive to missingness in the<br>outcome being related to its true value. For time-to-event-data, the analogue is that rates of<br>censoring (loss to follow-up) differ between the intervention groups.<br>2. Reported reasons for missing outcome data provide evidence that missingness in the outcome<br>depends on its true value;<br>3. Reported reasons for missing outcome data differ between the intervention groups;<br>4. The circumstances of the trial make it likely that missingness in the outcome depends on its true<br>value. For example, in trials of interventions to treat schizophrenia it is widely understood that<br>continuing symptoms make drop out more likely.<br>5. In time-to-event analyses, participants’ follow up is censored when they stop or change their<br>assigned intervention, for example because of drug toxicity or, in cancer trials, when participants<br>switch to second-line chemotherapy.<br>Answer ‘No’ if the analysis accounted for participant characteristics that are likely to explain the<br>relationship between missingness in the outcome and its true value.|NA/Y/PY/PN/N/NI|

|~~**4.1 Was the method of**~~<br>**measuring the outcome**<br>**inappropriate?**<br>|~~This question aims to identify methods of outcome measurement (data collection) that are unsuitable for~~<br>the outcome they are intended to evaluate.

In most circumstances, for pre-specified outcomes, the answer to this question will be ‘No’ or<br>‘Probably no’.<br>Answer ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’ if the method of measuring the outcome is inappropriate, for example<br>because:<br>(1) it is unlikely to be sensitive to plausible intervention effects (e.g. important ranges of outcome<br>values fall outside levels that are detectable using the measurement method); or<br>(2) the measurement instrument has been demonstrated to have poor validity.<br>|~~Y/PY/PN/N/NI ~~<br>|

|~~**5.3 ... multiple eligible**~~<br>**analyses of the data?**|~~A particular outcome measurement may be analysed in multiple ways. Examples include: unadjusted~~<br>and adjusted models; final value vs change from baseline vs analysis of covariance; transformations of<br>variables; different definitions of composite outcomes (e.g. ‘major adverse event’); conversion of<br>continuously scaled outcome to categorical data with different cut-points; different sets of covariates<br>for adjustment; and different strategies for dealing with missing data. Application of multiple<br>methods generates multiple effect estimates for a specific outcome measurement.

**Overall risk-of-bias judgement** **Criteria**

Low risk of bias The study is judged to be at **low risk of bias** **for all domains** for this result.

Some concerns The study is judged to raise **some concerns** in at least one domain for this result, but not to be at high risk of bias for any
domain.

High risk of bias The study is judged to be at **high risk of bias** in at least one domain for this result.
Or
The study is judged to have **some concerns** for **multiple domains** in a way that substantially lowers confidence in the
result.
