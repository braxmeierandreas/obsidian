**1. Introduction**



A B S T R A C T


Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in the United States (U.S.) is far below the _Healthy People 2020_
goal of 80% coverage among adolescents. In rural communities, HPV vaccination coverage is low, yet incidence
and mortality rates of HPV-associated cancer are high. Much of the research focused on HPV vaccination in rural
U.S. communities has involved qualitative investigations, observations, survey research, and secondary data
analysis with limited implementation of interventional study designs. The purpose of this narrative review was to
examine intervention studies to increase HPV vaccination in rural settings and to summarize study characteristics
and associated outcomes. PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched utilizing systematic
narrative review methodology for studies describing implementation of HPV vaccination interventions in rural U.
S. settings from January 2006–December 2019. Using specific search criteria, 991 studies were identified. After
abstract review, 30 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and 15 met the inclusion criteria. The 15 articles

 - published from 2011 to 2019 – described HPV vaccination interventions in rural settings of six states, including
communities, health clinics, and schools. A range of primary and secondary outcomes were reported, including
HPV vaccine receipt (series initiation, continuation, and/or completion); HPV vaccine knowledge; and/or cer­
vical cancer knowledge. Across the studies, there was an absence of the description of rural context. As compared
to the broader HPV vaccination intervention literature, interventions in rural settings were limited. More
interventional research is needed in rural communities given the elevated rates of HPV-related cancer and low
rates of HPV vaccine uptake.



Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually trans­
mitted infection (STI) in the United States (U.S.) (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2017a; Chesson et al., 2014). Surveillance data
suggest 45,300 cases of HPV-associated cancer, including cervical,
vaginal, vulvar, oropharyngeal, anal, and penile, occur annually in the
U.S. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). People living in
rural areas are disproportionately impacted by HPV-associated cancers
(Zahnd et al., 2018, 2019b). A recent analysis of rural-urban differences



in HPV-associated cancers showed rural females had significantly higher
rates of cervical, vaginal, vulvar, oropharyngeal, and anal cancer when
compared with urban counterparts (Zahnd et al., 2019b). Rural males
had higher rates of penile cancer as compared with urban counterparts
(Zahnd et al., 2019b). Additional disparities in HPV-associated cancers
in rural settings by race and ethnicity were found; for example, nonHispanic Black women residing in rural areas had higher rates of cer­
vical cancer than non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women (Zahnd
et al., 2019b). These findings underscore the significant burden of HPVrelated cancers in rural communities and the tremendous opportunity

for intervention to prevent these cancers (Vanderpool et al., 2019).
Despite the significant cancer burden associated with HPV _and_ the
advent of a safe and effective prophylactic vaccine, HPV vaccination
rates remain below national goals for both adolescents and young adults
(Meites et al., 2016). For 14 years, vaccination has been available to
protect against HPV types that lead to cancer in males and females.
Current HPV vaccine recommendations target 11–12-year-olds starting
as early as age 9 and up to age 26; shared clinical decision-making has
been recommended for some adults aged 27 to 45 who are not
adequately vaccinated (Meites et al., 2019). The focus on adolescents
remains a priority for optimizing the benefits of HPV prevention,
particularly in rural communities. National Immunization Survey-Teen
(NIS-Teen) data (2019) showed HPV vaccination uptake was lower
among rural-dwelling adolescents (non-metropolitan statistical areas

[MSAs]) as compared to those in urban settings (MSAs) with rural up-todate rates of 47.3% (an _increase_ of 6.6% from 2018) compared to 54.2%
in the U.S. overall (an _increase_ of 3.1% from 2018) and 57.1% in MSA
principal cities (an _increase_ of 1% from 2018) (Elam-Evans et al., 2020).
Rural residents in the U.S. face multiple and unique barriers
accessing health care, and specifically related to HPV vaccination
(Newcomer et al., 2020; Peterson et al., 2020; US Department of Health
and Human Services, 2020a, 2020b). Rural residents have demonstrated
lower knowledge of HPV vaccination, which may result in lower rates of
HPV vaccination uptake (Boyd et al., 2018; Mohammed et al., 2018).
Healthcare provider shortages in rural settings may also lead to fewer
access points for HPV vaccination (Shipman et al., 2011). Notably, rural
areas are recognized for poor health outcomes, including lower child­
hood and adult immunization rates (Elam-Evans et al., 2020; Hill et al.,
2018; Hughes et al., 2019; McLaughlin et al., 2019; Walker et al., 2018;
Walker et al., 2019), limited access to healthcare services (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2017b; Jones et al., 2009), and lower
socioeconomic status (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2017b; Jones et al., 2009). These factors provide the impetus for
research designed to understand and address barriers and facilitators of
HPV vaccination across multiple levels of influence in rural communities
(Newcomer et al., 2020; Peterson et al., 2020; Vanderpool et al., 2019).
To date, the majority of HPV vaccination research in rural U.S.
communities has used non-interventional study methodologies, such as
qualitative research, observations, surveys, and secondary data analyses
to assess HPV and vaccine-related knowledge and attitudes (Blake et al.,
2015; Kepka et al., 2011; Luque et al., 2011; Merzouk et al., 2011;
Mohammed et al., 2018; Vanderpool et al., 2015b), vaccine accept­
ability (Cates et al., 2009; Reiter et al., 2014; Tiggelaar et al., 2014),
intention to vaccinate (Fazekas et al., 2008; Reiter et al., 2013; Sperber
et al., 2008; Spleen et al., 2012), vaccine recommendations / commu­
nication (Bednarczyk et al., 2017; Bhatta and Phillips, 2015; Moss et al.,
2016), barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination uptake and
completion (Boyd et al., 2018; Cartmell et al., 2018; Head et al., 2013),
feedback on HPV vaccination messaging (Cates et al., 2015, 2012;
Shafer et al., 2011), predictors of HPV vaccination (Casey et al., 2013;
Gerend et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2016), and HPV vaccination rates
(Barefoot et al., 2017; Henry et al., 2017; Vielot et al., 2017). These
studies have been conducted among adolescents and young adults,
parents/guardians, and healthcare providers in rural communities
across the U.S., including foci on Latinx, African American, and Appa­
lachian populations. This research has been important to understand the
landscape of factors associated with HPV vaccination and nonvaccination for descriptive purposes, but limits guidance on how to in­
crease uptake of HPV vaccination through interventions.
In comparison, interventional HPV vaccination study designs, such
as randomized control trials (RCT), quasi-experimental studies, and
pragmatic trials, focused on _changing_ HPV vaccination-related outcomes
have been less commonly conducted in rural U.S. communities. To
reduce the burden of HPV-associated cancers in rural settings and
improve low HPV vaccination uptake, investigation of efforts to inter­
vene to increase participation in HPV prevention is needed. Therefore,



the purpose of this narrative review was to examine the body of inter­
ventional HPV vaccination research conducted in rural U.S. areas since
the introduction of the first HPV vaccine in 2006 and to assess study
populations, geographic locations, intervention components, interven­
tion design, outcome measure(s), and primary study findings. Com­
monalities and differences among the identified studies, scientific gaps,
and recommendations to increase HPV vaccination interventional
research in rural communities are reported herein.


**2. Methods**


_2.1. Search strategy_


In this review, we aimed to provide an overview of the current state
of HPV vaccination interventions in rural U.S. communities by
employing a narrative review methodology (Green et al., 2006; Gregory
and Denniss, 2018). The process involved systematically searching four
electronic databases with the most relevant HPV vaccination interven­
tion publications. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cumulative
Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of
Science for articles from January 2006–December 2019. With the
assistance of a health sciences research librarian, the research team
developed search criteria for each database (Table 1). Relevant key

terms, such as immunization, vaccination, rural, and papillomavirus,
used in each database were identified and applied. In PubMed, key terms
were searched for as medical subject heading (MeSH) and text words
(tw) fields; in PsycINFO, subject (DE), title (TI), and abstract (AB) fields;
in CINAHL, exact subject heading (MH), title (TI), and abstract (AB); and
in Web of Science, exact terms. The code in Table 1 was used to identify
articles meeting the specified criteria.
For inclusion in our review, articles had to meet the definition of
“intervention”, which was defined as “…any activity undertaken with
the objective of improving human health by preventing disease, by
curing or reducing the severity or duration of an existing disease, or by
restoring function lost through disease or injury” (Smith et al., 2015). In
addition, we used the following inclusion criteria: (a) focused on a rural
U.S. setting (i.e., using the word _rural_ to describe the setting and/or
referencing an official definition of rural); (b) focused on HPV vacci­
nation receipt, including first dose, series continuation (as applicable),
and/or series completion, as an outcome; and (c) contained full article
access in English, including study description and results. No restrictions
on target population of the intervention were included in the inclusion
criteria.


_2.2. Screening procedures_


One research team member reviewed the citation details of identified
records to remove duplicate records. Two research team members
screened the title and abstracts of non-duplicative records to identify
articles for full-text review. Titles, abstracts, and full articles were
reviewed by the same two members of the research team who then met
to compare decisions and reconcile disagreement by consensus to
determine article classification. This screening process continued until
the final set of articles was determined.


_2.3. Data extraction_


The search yielded 15 intervention articles that were analyzed for
content based on study and intervention characteristics and results. Two
members of the research team systematically abstracted the following
information from each article: geographic location of the intervention,
target population(s), sample size, intervention setting, intervention and
control characteristics, theoretical underpinnings, barriers and facilita­
tors, outcome measures, data sources, and results. In addition, each
study design was categorized based on the International Agency for
Research on Cancer classification system for study designs (dos Santos
Silva, 1999). Study design types were then expanded to include quasiexperimental designs. The abstracted data were compiled into tables
and reviewed by each research team member. Modifications were made
following research team discussion, when needed.


**3. Results**


The narrative review process is depicted in Fig. 1. One research team
member reviewed the citation details of the 991 records (417 PubMed;
73 PsycINFO; 194 CINAHL; 307 Web of Science) identified through the
study selection process to remove duplicates resulting in 518 records to
be screened further. Two research team members screened the titles and
abstracts of these 518 non-duplicative records (417 PubMed; 3 Psy­
cINFO; 39 CINAHL; 59 Web of Science) resulting in the identification of
30 records for full-text review. The study selection process resulted in 15
records to be included in the synthesis process. Fifteen records were
excluded from further review due to the following reasons: secondary
analysis ( _n_ = 6), rural setting unknown ( _n_ = 5), absence of an HPV
vaccination outcome ( _n_ = 2), protocol paper describing a study to be
conducted ( _n_ = 1), and inability to access the full text of the article (n =
1) (Fig. 1).
Our narrative literature review identified 15 articles focused on HPV
vaccination interventions in rural U.S. settings published from 2011 to



2019 (Brewer et al., 2017; Carman et al., 2015; Cates et al., 2018, 2011;
Chung et al., 2015; Crosby et al., 2011; Kaul et al., 2019; Paskett et al.,
2016; Richman et al., 2019, 2016; Szilagyi et al., 2015; Underwood
et al., 2015; Vanderpool et al., 2015a, 2013; Vogel et al., 2018), which
are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.


_3.1. Study characteristics_


Table 2 provides characteristics of included studies, such as study
design, intervention and control conditions, target population, inter­
vention target, and study setting. The most commonly reported study
design was a RCT (Brewer et al., 2017; Paskett et al., 2016; Richman
et al., 2016, 2019; Szilagyi et al., 2015; Underwood et al., 2015; Van­
derpool et al., 2013).
Intervention types included patient, parent, and/or provider in­
terventions in healthcare settings (Brewer et al., 2017; Cates et al., 2018,
2011; Chung et al., 2015; Crosby et al., 2011; Paskett et al., 2016;
Richman et al., 2019, 2016; Szilagyi et al., 2015; Vogel et al., 2018) and
educational interventions, including social marketing and communica­
tion campaigns, in communities and high schools (Carman et al., 2015;
Cates et al., 2011; Kaul et al., 2019; Underwood et al., 2015; Vanderpool
et al., 2015a, 2013). Eight of 15 studies used multilevel approaches
focusing on at least two levels (Cates et al., 2011, 2018; Chung et al.,
2015; Kaul et al., 2019; Paskett et al., 2016; Underwood et al., 2015;
Vanderpool et al., 2015a; Vogel et al., 2018), such as organizational (e.
g., clinic, school) or community, parent, and/or individual levels.
Intervention content was primarily educational and delivered via
training or instruction, print materials, social marketing campaigns,
reminders and informational telephone calls, and/or DVD. One study
used free HPV vaccination in the form of a voucher as the main inter­
vention (Crosby et al., 2011).
Twelve studies reported intervention and control or comparison
conditions employing an experimental design (Brewer et al., 2017; Cates
et al., 2011, 2018; Chung et al., 2015; Kaul et al., 2019; Paskett et al.,
2016; Richman et al., 2016, 2019; Szilagyi et al., 2015; Underwood
et al., 2015; Vanderpool et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2018). Seven of these
studies randomized to either the intervention or control / comparison
condition, with four of these randomized at the group level (either clinic
or school) (Brewer et al., 2017; Paskett et al., 2016; Szilagyi et al., 2015;
Underwood et al., 2015) and three at the individual level (Richman
et al., 2016, 2019; Vanderpool et al., 2013). In addition, seven of these
studies reported multilevel interventions (Cates et al., 2011, 2018;
Chung et al., 2015; Kaul et al., 2019; Paskett et al., 2016; Underwood
et al., 2015; Vogel et al., 2018), while five targeted one level of inter­
vention (Brewer et al., 2017; Richman et al., 2016, 2019; Szilagyi et al.,
2015; Vanderpool et al., 2013). Three studies reported no control or
comparison condition and were intervention-only study designs (Car­
man et al., 2015; Crosby et al., 2011; Vanderpool et al., 2015a). Two of
these three studies were singular in level of focus (Carman et al., 2015;
Crosby et al., 2011) as compared to one that was multilevel (Vanderpool
et al., 2015a).
We examined articles for theoretical underpinnings and formative
research leading to the intervention research reported in the included
studies ( _data not shown_ ). Chung et al. (2015) did not provide information
on theory or formative research as part of intervention development
(Chung et al., 2015). In seven of the studies, formative research building
on the work of the authors and/or previously published research was
reported to have informed intervention development (Brewer et al.,
2017; Cates et al., 2018; Crosby et al., 2011; Kaul et al., 2019; Richman
et al., 2016; Richman et al., 2019; Vanderpool et al., 2015a). The
remaining seven studies reported or described theoretical underpinnings
(Carman et al., 2015; Cates et al., 2011; Paskett et al., 2016; Szilagyi
et al., 2015; Underwood et al., 2015; Vanderpool et al., 2013; Vogel
et al., 2018). Most theories were individual-level health behavior the­
ories, such as the health belief model (HBM) and theory of reasoned
action (TRA). In Carman et al. (2015) and Paskett et al. (2016),

organizational theory was applied (Carman et al., 2015; Paskett et al.,
2016). Paskett et al. (2016) also included organizational theory with the
HBM, TRA, and extended parallel process model (Paskett et al., 2016). In
Vanderpool et al. (2013), diffusion of innovation coupled with theory of
planned behavior was used (Vanderpool et al., 2013).
The target population and setting for the 15 studies included a rural
focus. Seven studies were conducted in rural North Carolina or included
regions of North Carolina considered rural (Brewer et al., 2017; Cates
et al., 2011, 2018; Chung et al., 2015; Richman et al., 2016, 2019; Vogel
et al., 2018). Of those in North Carolina, Brewer et al. (2017) was
conducted in 29 healthcare clinics (Brewer et al., 2017); Cates et al.
(2011) was in four rural counties (Cates et al., 2011); Cates et al. (2018)
was in rural primary care practices (Cates et al., 2018); Chung et al.
(2015) was in one rural county (Chung et al., 2015); Richman et al.
(2016) was in the rural eastern part of the state in a university setting
(Richman et al., 2016); Richman et al. (2019) in two rural healthcare
clinics (Richman et al., 2019); and Vogel et al. (2018) was in a rural
healthcare clinic (Vogel et al., 2018). Four studies were conducted in
rural Kentucky, specifically the 54 counties designated as Appalachian
(Carman et al., 2015; Crosby et al., 2011; Vanderpool et al., 2013,
2015a). Of those in Kentucky, Carman et al. (2015) was in rural local
health departments (Carman et al., 2015); Crosby et al. (2011) was in
rural healthcare clinics, a rural community college, and in an urban
university health clinic (Crosby et al., 2011); Vanderpool et al. (2013)
was conducted in eight rural counties in community settings (Vander­
pool et al., 2013) and (Vanderpool et al., 2015a) was conducted in two
rural high schools in southeastern Kentucky (Vanderpool et al., 2015a).
One additional study was conducted in Appalachia; Paskett et al. (2016)



was conducted in six Appalachian Ohio counties (Paskett et al., 2016).
Additional rural settings included Texas (Kaul et al., 2019), New York
(Szilagyi et al., 2015) and Georgia (Underwood et al., 2015). Although
all studies included in the narrative review met the inclusion criterion of
rural U.S. setting, we note none of the studies explicitly defined rural nor
provided additional information on the rural setting beyond the ‘rural’
descriptor.


_3.2. Study results_


Table 3 summarizes the primary and secondary outcomes, data
sources, and selected results from the 15 included studies. In terms of
primary and secondary outcomes, all 15 studies included receipt of an
HPV vaccine dose(s), either initiation (first dose), continuation (second
dose), and/or completion (third dose), as a primary outcome. Primary
outcomes were measured in terms of clinic-level data change over time
or individual-level data (e.g., percentage, cumulative percentage, total
number of doses) from a range of data sources (e.g., medical records,
self-report, immunization registries).
Among the 12 studies using experimental designs, HPV vaccination
outcomes were positive in eight studies (Brewer et al., 2017; Cates et al.,
2011, 2018; Chung et al., 2015; Kaul et al., 2019; Paskett et al., 2016;
Vanderpool et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2018); intervention effects were
not observed in four studies (Richman et al., 2016, 2019; Szilagyi et al.,
2015; Underwood et al., 2015). Among the three studies not using
experimental designs, two had positive HPV vaccination outcomes
(Crosby et al., 2011; Vanderpool et al., 2015a), and one study showed no
effect (Carman et al., 2015). Secondary outcomes included: number of

vaccination reminders sent, assessment of organizational readiness,
missed opportunities for HPV vaccination, educational campaign
awareness, provider knowledge, provision of educational materials to
parents and adolescents, and HPV vaccine beliefs, attitudes, and deci­
sion-making.
Variability in data source, measurement timing, and target age group
existed across nine of the studies demonstrating statistically significant
increases in HPV vaccination (Brewer et al., 2017; Cates et al., 2011,
2018; Chung et al., 2015; Crosby et al., 2011; Kaul et al., 2019; Paskett
et al., 2016; Vanderpool et al., 2013, 2015a). Vogel et al. (2018) showed
positive, but not statistically significant, results (Vogel et al., 2018).
Brewer et al. (2017), Cates et al. (2011), Cates et al. (2018), and Chung
et al. (2015) used a state immunization registry for HPV vaccination
rates (Brewer et al., 2017; Cates et al., 2011, 2018; Chung et al., 2015).
Brewer et al. (2017) used 11–12 and 13–17 as the two age groups with

HPV vaccination assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months (Brewer
et al., 2017); Cates et al. (2011) calculated a monthly cumulative rate of
HPV vaccination for girls aged 9–13 and 14–19 for one year (Cates et al.,
2011); Cates et al. (2018) focused on HPV vaccination initiation and
completion 9 months pre-intervention, 9 months during the interven­
tion, and 9 months post-intervention for 11–12 year olds (Cates et al.,
2018); and Chung et al. (2015) examined HPV vaccination rates at
baseline, 6 months, and 12 months for 11–12 year olds and 13–18 year
olds (Chung et al., 2015). Kaul et al. (2019) and Vanderpool et al.
(2015a) relied on school medical records to assess HPV vaccination rates
(Kaul et al., 2019; Vanderpool et al., 2015a). Kaul et al. (2019) examined
rates among sixth to eighth grade students at baseline and then 12, 18,
and 20 months (Kaul et al., 2019). Vanderpool et al. (2015a) monitored
uptake and completion rates during one school year (Vanderpool et al.,
2015a). Crosby et al. (2011) relied on voucher redemption to determine
dose received by vaccine-eligible women aged 18–26 (Crosby et al.,
2011). Paskett et al. (2016) used medical record data and parent selfreport to measure HPV vaccine initiation 3 months post-intervention
and completion 6 months post-intervention among girls aged 9–17
(Paskett et al., 2016). Vanderpool et al. (2013) examined medical re­
cords of women aged 18–26 up to 9 months after the initial dose was
received (Vanderpool et al., 2013). Data issues were also observed
throughout the included studies. There was difficulty in obtaining
needed data, including missing, limited, or incomplete data (Carman
et al., 2015; Cates et al., 2011, 2018; Chung et al., 2015; Kaul et al.,
2019; Paskett et al., 2016) and challenges accessing data through im­
munization registries (Chung et al., 2015); issues due to validity of selfreported data were also noted (Crosby et al., 2011). In addition, there
were differences in baseline HPV coverage between intervention arms
(Brewer et al., 2017; Cates et al., 2018).


_3.3. Barriers and facilitators_


Many of the included studies also noted barriers and facilitators to
implementing HPV vaccination interventions among rural populations
(Table 4). These are organized by major domains of study design and
measurement, intervention characteristics, implementation processes,
and HPV vaccination access. A range of barriers were reported, most
reflecting implementation challenges. Facilitators showed more
congruence in attributes of the intervention and implementation pro­
cesses enhancing the study and observed outcomes. Additionally, there
was heterogeneity across the studies related to specific facilitators. For
example, several studies determined that incentives or providing the
HPV vaccine at no cost was not enough to increase HPV vaccination
rates among their target population (Chung et al., 2015; Crosby et al.,
2011), while others found these strategies to be beneficial (Carman
et al., 2015; Vanderpool et al., 2013; Vanderpool et al., 2015a). Studies
also found different age groups to be more effective for targeting. Chung
et al. (2015) found younger age groups to be more effective due to
existing vaccination requirements (Chung et al., 2015) while Under­
wood et al. (2015) found high school-aged students to be a better target
population (Underwood et al., 2015). In addition, females and those
with private health insurance were found to have higher odds of
completing the HPV vaccine series (Underwood et al., 2015).


_3.4. Synthesis_


In terms of intervention effects on HPV vaccine outcomes, nine of the
15 included studies demonstrated a positive, statistically significant
increase in HPV vaccination post-intervention (Brewer et al., 2017;
Cates et al., 2011, 2018; Chung et al., 2015; Crosby et al., 2011; Kaul
et al., 2019; Paskett et al., 2016; Vanderpool et al., 2013, 2015a). Among
these nine studies, six included a focus on the clinical setting and/or
healthcare providers (Brewer et al., 2017; Cates et al., 2011, 2018;
Chung et al., 2015; Crosby et al., 2011; Paskett et al., 2016) and spe­
cifically on provider recommendation for HPV vaccination. The other



three studies showing positive effects were in schools ( _n_ = 2) (Kaul et al.,
2019; Vanderpool et al., 2015a) and the community ( _n_ = 1) (Vanderpool
et al., 2013). Overall, the majority of interventions described herein
proved successful in increasing HPV vaccination behaviors, overcoming
different barriers and capitalizing on facilitators.


**4. Discussion**


As compared to the broader HPV vaccination intervention literature
(Francis et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2014; Jacobson et al., 2016; Niccolai and
Hansen, 2015; Paul and Fabio, 2014; Smulian et al., 2016; Walling et al.,
2016), there is a paucity of intervention studies based in rural U.S.
settings. Thus, narrative review methodology was a more suitable
approach as compared to other types of review. Due to the limited HPV
vaccination intervention literature in rural U.S. communities, we are
somewhat limited in our ability to draw conclusions and identify rec­
ommendations. However, the impetus for increasing HPV vaccination in
rural settings to decrease HPV-associated cancer disparities is well
documented and recognized on a national level (Blake et al., 2017;
Implementation Science Working Group, 2020; National Cancer Insti­
tute, 2016, 2018, 2019). Rural populations represent a key population in
which to address low HPV vaccination uptake and prevention of HPVassociated cancers (Williams et al., 2020; Zahnd et al., 2018, 2019b).
We used this premise as a means for discussing the implications of the
narrative review findings.
Twelve of the 15 identified studies used experimental designs to test
intervention conditions in comparison to control condition(s) (Brewer
et al., 2017; Cates et al., 2011, 2018; Chung et al., 2015; Kaul et al.,
2019; Paskett et al., 2016; Richman et al., 2016, 2019; Szilagyi et al.,
2015; Underwood et al., 2015; Vanderpool et al., 2013; Vogel et al.,
2018). The remaining three studies used intervention-only designs
(Carman et al., 2015; Crosby et al., 2011; Vanderpool et al., 2015a). Of
the 12 studies using experimental designs, five used comparison con­
ditions (Cates et al., 2011, 2018; Chung et al., 2015; Kaul et al., 2019;
Vogel et al., 2018) as opposed to usual care or standard-of-care or no
intervention control groups. To determine the most effective interven­
tion approaches, studies employing experimental designs - with and
without randomization – in rural settings are needed to more compre­
hensively ascertain how intervention approaches are and are not suc­
cessful in overcoming barriers in rural settings. This may be particularly
important for elucidating the best implementation strategies for inter­
vention research in rural contexts. Experimental designs in rural settings
may pose challenges that must be overcome through use of an expanded
collection of study designs, such as the application of “n-of-1” designs,
wait-list control designs, stepped-wedge designs, and sequential multi­
ple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designs, to allow for effective
comparison of intervention and control conditions. Research on
increasing HPV vaccination in rural U.S. communities should include
robust study designs to allow for a greater understanding of effective
implementation approaches suitable for replication and scaling to other
rural settings. In cases where experimental designs may not be suitable
or appropriate, future research should report the rationale for choosing
non-experimental designs to aid in understanding important contextual
factors in rural communities.
Eight studies used multilevel intervention conditions – seven with an
experimental design (Cates et al., 2011, 2018; Chung et al., 2015; Kaul
et al., 2019; Paskett et al., 2016; Underwood et al., 2015; Vogel et al.,
2018) and one with an intervention-only design (Vanderpool et al.,
2015a). Multilevel interventions were most often conducted at the
organizational/clinic-level, provider-level, and/or individual/parentlevel. Previous research has shown multilevel approaches are more
effective than singular level approaches in increasing HPV vaccination
outcomes (National HPV Vaccination Roundtable, 2019; Rodriguez
et al., 2020). Additionally, few studies employed multi-component in­
terventions. Multi-component, multilevel interventions allow for
implementation of myriad strategies to overcome barriers and enhance

facilitators to HPV vaccination in rural settings. A recent scoping review
determined that barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination series up­
take and completion in rural populations have been heavily documented
at the individual level (e.g., caregiver knowledge, HPV vaccination be­
liefs), yet further research is needed on these factors at other levels of
influence (Peterson et al., 2020). In the included studies, several barriers
across multiple levels were reported. Use of multi-component, multi­
level approaches require sophisticated evaluation plans to ensure mea­
surement of key variables can result in identifying correlates of
favorable and unfavorable outcomes. We found limited evidence of
theory-guided interventions. Approximately half of the included studies
referenced theoretical underpinnings in intervention design and even
fewer in measurement and results. In combination with multicomponent, multilevel interventions, theoretically-informed in­
terventions and measures may result in more effectively managing
barriers and capitalizing on facilitators.
Among the eight studies using multilevel interventions, the levels
targeted were easily discernable aiding in interpretation of the ap­
proaches; however, in most cases, corresponding primary outcomes
were at only one level as compared to each level at which intervention
occurred. While multi-component, multilevel intervention approaches
are recommended to increase HPV vaccination, particularly in rural
settings, ensuring measurement across components and levels is needed
in future research. For HPV vaccination intervention research, the
desired behavioral change most appropriate to include is an HPV
vaccination outcome, which was the case for all 15 studies in this re­
view. However, greater consistency in measurement and reporting of
HPV vaccination is needed. In the included studies, different ages (e.g.,
9–13, 11–12, 13–17, 18–26 years), one or both sexes (e.g., females only,
both females and males), data sources (e.g., medical chart, parent selfreport, school nurse records, state immunization registries), time
points (e.g., 3 6, 12, 18, 20 months), and values (e.g., initiation rate,
completion rate, cumulative percentages, total number of doses, missed
opportunities) were reported. The variability in measurement and
reporting created challenges in comparing outcomes across studies
demonstrating statistically significant results. According to the most
recent HPV vaccine recommendations, for 9–14 year old youth, a 2-dose
regimen is recommended with doses at 0 (day of first dose) and 6–12
months after the first dose, and for 15–45 year old individuals, a 3-dose
regimen is recommended at 0, 1–2 months, and 6 months (Meites et al.,
2019). Some included studies were published prior to the 2016 change
to two doses for those who initiate before age 15. However, going for­
ward, utilizing consistent time points and values, at a minimum, will be
important for assessing comparability and discerning effective ap­
proaches to increase HPV vaccination outcomes. Such consistency may
also allow for comparisons to NIS-TEEN data, for example. Consistent
measurement and reporting across multiple levels and for multiple
components will aid in understanding the most effective approaches to
increase HPV vaccination in rural settings.
There has been ample discussion about the definition of rural in the
U.S. (Gessert et al., 2015). This discussion extends beyond mere defi­
nitions and implies a need for greater measurement and description of
rural context (Do et al., 2020; Zahnd et al., 2019a). National reports
(American Hospital Association, 2019; Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health, 2018; National Quality Forum, 2018; US Department of
Health and Human Services, 2020a, 2020b) have identified numerous
strengths of rural communities, such as willingness to focus on capacity
building efforts building on existing resources and addressing disparate
health indicators and outcomes (Appalachian Regional Commission,
2018), including lower HPV vaccination uptake and higher rates of HPVassociated cancers. Across the 15 included studies, no study explicitly
defined rural and few provided contextual information on the rural
setting. Perhaps authors assumed use of the descriptor ‘rural’ and/or the
location (e.g., Appalachia) would convey the rural setting. Few articles
included the rural locale as part of the discussion section. A clear basis
for how and why a target population and setting is ‘rural’ would allow

for future research to understand how a proposed rural setting may or
may not align with previous research in rural communities. Providing a
documented definition of rural will serve as a starting point for under­
standing HPV vaccination approaches in settings described as rural.
More detailed reporting on contextual factors is needed as well. For
example, we were unable to discern how intersectionality was consid­
ered in the studies. By this, we mean a rural, uninsured, racial or ethnic
minority parent may face different challenges to HPV vaccination for a
child as compared to a rural, insured, White parent. Reporting on
contextual factors in rural communities, such as healthcare provider
shortage areas, proximity to primary care/medical home, and avail­
ability of HPV vaccination access points (e.g., clinics, pharmacies, ur­
gent care), will strengthen the ability to apply approaches in other rural
communities.
To improve reporting of geographic definitions and contextual in­
formation, at a minimum, studies should report the geographic location
(s) of the study using an existing rural-urban metric or classification
code such as MSA / non-MSA, Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC), or
Rural-Urban Commuting Areas (RUCA). Recently, the National Cancer
Institute’s (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences has
called on investigators to clearly define rural in their grant applications
using RUCC, RUCA, or Frontier and Remote Area Codes (Kennedy et al.,
2018; US Department of Health and Human Services, 2020a, 2020b).
Moreover, existing reporting guidelines aimed at promoting consistency
in intervention reporting and replication and translating evidence into
practice could promote more detailed geographic descriptions in their
requirements. We reviewed the AIMD framework, Standards for
Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI) checklist, Template for
Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR), and Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) (Bragge et al., 2017; Pinnock
et al., 2017; Hoffman et al., 2014; Welch et al., 2017). Context (e.g.,
description of who, what, where, when, and how) is included as part of
reporting, yet there is less explicit direction on providing context about
the rural setting, rural-residing populations, and logistical and practical
considerations of working in rural communities.
Notably, the geographic distribution of the study locations was
limited as most were based in Kentucky and North Carolina. We propose
additional research be conducted across the U.S. Midwest, Southwest,
West, and the Delta and Blackbelt regions of the South to further explore
the impact of interventional research on HPV vaccination outcomes in
rural communities – particularly those with increased HPV-related dis­
ease burden – and among specific sub-populations (e.g., American In­
dians, African Americans, Hispanics) to assess cultural-specific aspects
that may intersect with geography. There has been important HPV
vaccination-related formative, survey, and descriptive research con­
ducted in these regions (Boyd et al., 2018; Inguva et al., 2020; Kepka
et al., 2011; Koskan et al., 2019; Luque et al., 2011; Newcomer et al.,
2020; Vickers et al., 2019) indicating both the need and capacity for
interventional studies focused on improving HPV vaccination outcomes.
In some regards, our findings are not unexpected. There has been a
limited focus on cancer prevention and control, including HPV vacci­
nation, in rural settings (Blake et al., 2015; Vanderpool et al., 2019).
When examining NCI’s Evidence-Based Cancer Control Programs (Na­
tional Cancer Institute, 2020), only two of the six evidence-based in­
terventions on HPV vaccination included a rural setting, one of which is
included in our narrative review (Vanderpool et al., 2013) and one of
which is identified as having a rural focus but with no rural content in
the article itself (Perkins et al., 2015). The absence of federally-funded
cancer research in rural settings (Blake et al., 2017; Weaver et al.,
2020) has led to an increased focus on cancer prevention in rural settings
(Implementation Science Working Group, 2020; National Cancer Insti­
tute, 2018, 2019; Weaver et al., 2020), especially in light of documented
disparities in cancer outcomes. National initiatives, such as the Cancer
Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel prioritization of evidence-based HPV
vaccination interventions (National Cancer Institute, 2016) and NCIdesignated cancer centers convening to prevent HPV-associated



cancers through increased vaccination, offer a means to augment these
activities in rural settings.


_4.1. Study limitations and strengths_


Our study has notable strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to review the existing literature on HPV vaccination interventions
in rural U.S. settings. In addition, our search utilized a wide scope of
articles from four major databases. All authors engaged in review of
procedures at each stage of the identification, review, and analysis
process to allow for multiple reviewers determining inclusion and
assessing study characteristics. However, our study has limitations given
the paucity of published articles on HPV vaccination interventions in
rural settings. The inclusion criteria allowed for only 15 studies to be
fully examined, thereby limiting our ability to characterize intervention
approaches and examine HPV vaccination outcomes beyond providing
description and a summary. Further, our review was limited to in­
terventions conducted in the U.S. and without representation across
rural communities in the U.S. There was an over-representation of
studies from certain regions and with limited sub-populations, as noted
previously. Some articles were excluded because of a lack of a discern­
able, clear focus on intervention efforts to increase HPV vaccination in
_rural_ areas. The exclusion may have derived from a lack of an explicit
intervention design while focusing on HPV vaccination in rural areas; a
lack of clarity about a focus on receipt of one or more doses of HPV
vaccine as opposed to HPV vaccination intention in combination with
other vaccines (e.g., influenza) even if situated in rural areas; and/or
HPV vaccination knowledge rather than behavior.


**5. Conclusion**


Our narrative review revealed few HPV vaccination intervention
studies have been conducted in rural U.S. settings given available pub­
lished articles. This is concerning given the low uptake of HPV vacci­
nation and high burden of HPV-associated disease in rural settings.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, early evidence has shown a decrease in
vaccination coverage, which could further impact existing HPV-related
disparities (Bramer et al., 2020; Hoffman, 2020; Santoli et al., 2020).
Future research is needed to expand on the literature of HPV vaccination
in rural settings to identify evidence-based interventions and imple­
mentation approaches unique to rural communities. This includes a
need for rigorous methods and experimental designs to compare in­
terventions and components of interventions; theory-guided interven­
tion development and related metrics; consistency in examining
behavioral outcomes (i.e., initiation, continuation, and/or completion of
HPV vaccination), age groups, and timeframes; and the effectiveness of
multi-component, multilevel interventions in rural settings. We also
identified a need to define ‘rural’ and ensure reporting of contextual
factors to better understand study results and application to other rural
settings. Due to the limited HPV vaccination intervention literature in
rural U.S. communities, we are somewhat limited in our ability to draw
conclusions. Yet the impetus for increasing HPV vaccination in rural
settings is well documented and recognized on a national level.
