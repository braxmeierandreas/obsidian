**Identification**

**Screening**

**Included**

\*Consider, if feasible to do so, reporting the number of records
identified from each database or register searched (rather than the
total number across all databases/registers).

\*\*If automation tools were used, indicate how many records were
excluded by a human and how many were excluded by automation tools.
