**Abstract**
The human papillomavirus (HPV) potentially affects every sexually active man in the United States and Canada. In
2017, the vaccine became publicly funded in Canada for males ages 9–26, and was integrated into school vaccination
programs. In 2019, HPV vaccination was recommended as routine for all U.S.-based males and females ages 9 through
26, and a shared decision for adults >26 years; however, since the approval of the vaccine in 2006 for females only, the
age and dosing recommendations for males have followed a complicated and changing trajectory. Current adherence
rates are low among college and university age males (18–26 years); therefore, understanding and addressing the
barriers and facilitators for men’s HPV vaccination is critically important. The purpose of the current scoping review
is to provide a synthesis of recent literature pertaining to HPV in college and university age men, as a means to
guiding health-care providers (HCPs). Drawing from 15 published articles, three thematic findings were inductively
derived. Theme one, _lack of awareness_, was underpinned by men’s knowledge deficits about their eligibility for, and
the availability of HPV vaccines. Theme two, _underestimating and embodying risk_, included men’s engagement in sexual
activities while misinformed or denying the risk for contracting HPV. The third theme, _strategies for increasing men’s_
_awareness_, summarizes messaging strategies used to lobby young men to vaccinate. The review findings indicate
gender-sensitive interventions targeting college-age men, including early, frequent, and consistent messaging on HPV
are key.

More than 70% of sexually active individuals will contract human papillomavirus (HPV) at some point in their
life (Canadian Public Health Agency, 2014). Other estimates of the lifetime probability of acquiring HPV are
higher than 80% (Chesson et al., 2014). The first vaccine
for HPV was introduced in the United States and Canada
in 2006; at that time, it was recommended for females
only, ages 9–26. In 2010, Health Canada expanded the
recommendation for population-wide vaccination to
include males of the same age range, although this strategy was not publicly funded until 2017. In the United
States, 2010 permissive recommendations similarly
extended HPV vaccination to males ages 9–26; in 2011,
the vaccine received a routine recommendation for males
ages 13–21, and a permissive recommendation for males
22–26 years. In 2019, routine recommendations changed
to include males (and females) 11–26 years and shared



decision-making for adults above 26 years. The history of
the guidelines is complex and consistently denied males
equal access to the health benefits of the vaccine, reflecting a schism between science, policy, and economics
(Daley et al., 2017). In Canada, universal health-care and
school programs cover the costs of the vaccine. In the
United States, due to a lack of basic health-care coverage

for all citizens, shifting vaccine recommendations
resulted in additional complicated insurance issues;
although public programs such as the federal Vaccines for
Children exist, debates over school vaccine programs
continue at the state level amid a patchwork of private
and public coverage (Centers for Disease Control [CDC],
2019a; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018; National
Conference on State Legislatures (NCSL), 2020).
Since the introduction of the vaccine for men, adherence has been staggeringly low (Bird et al., 2017).
According to a 2017 systematic review, male HPV vaccine adherence was only 47%, well below the >85%
target set by the Canadian government (Bird et al.,
2017). Similarly, in the United States, approximately
44% of teenage boys (aged 13–17) had the vaccine
(Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018), while among male
college students, 53% indicated they had received the
vaccine (American College Health Association, 2019).
Other research suggests that men’s HPV vaccine completion rates (comprising a series of three HPV vaccines
over 6 months at that time) were only 14% (Johnson
et al., 2017).
HPV can cause benign and malignant anogenital disease as well as head and neck lesions (Palefsky et al.,
2011). Most HPV infections in males (and females) are
asymptomatic, but often present as genital warts. The two
HPV strains most attributable to anogenital warts are
HPV types 6 and 11 (>90%) and 20%–50% of cases
involve a combined infection with oncogenic HPV types
(Palefsky et al., 2011). HPV types 16 and 18 are most
commonly associated with cancers of the penis, anus, and
oropharynx (Palefsky et al., 2011); oropharyngeal cancers comprise approximately 80% of HPV-associated
cancers in men each year (CDC, 2019b). HPV is also
believed to cause 90% of anal cancers, 60% of penile cancers, and is linked to 70% of oropharynx cancers (CDC,
2019c). Since the infections are typically asymptomatic
until life-changing progression occurs, vaccination is an
especially important protection and ideally prevention
strategy. To advance cancer prevention, it is essential that
HPV vaccination be adapted by men and women.


_HPV and the Impact of Vaccination for_
_College- and University-Age Males_


Upwards of 44,000 HPV-associated cancers occur in the
United States each year; 19,000 are diagnosed in men,
most commonly oropharyngeal cancer (CDC, 2019a, b,
c). In 2020, there remains no Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved test available to detect
the virus’s DNA in males. Males are unlikely to know if
they are infected with HPV, unless they have been diagnosed with anogenital warts, HPV-associated intraepithelial neoplasia, or HPV-related carcinoma (Workowski



& Bolan, 2015). Males have a high potential for developing serious life-changing disease as well as unknowingly
passing the virus on to their partners. Modeling predicting impacts of the vaccination on HPV type 16 infections
and cervical cancer predicted that vaccination of 80% of
12-year-old girls would reduce HPV type 16 prevalence
by 60%–100% in vaccinated, and 7%–31% in unvaccinated females; whereas, if 80% boys were also vaccinated, reductions would be 74%–100% in vaccinated and
86%–96% in unvaccinated females (Regan et al., 2007).
A population study of HPV-associated cancers concluded
that the HPV16/18 vaccine could prevent 60% of oropharyngeal cancers (Saraiya et al., 2015), which are most
common in males. In June 2020, the FDA approved
Gardasil 9 for the prevention of oropharyngeal cancer in
males and females, ages 9–45; however, additional clinical trials required to demonstrate benefit are needed
(F.D.A., 2020). With such potential reductions, the public
health benefits of increasing HPV vaccine adherence
among males are evident, and by extension, the avenues
for achieving widespread uptake of the vaccine are critically important.
In the unique context of HPV vaccines, it is fair to say
that men have been a latent target of messages to encourage vaccination (Pérez et al., 2015). To some extent, the
afterthought of targeting men has revealed gender-blind
public health practices that perhaps inadvertently led to
lobbying women to take responsibility for HPV vaccination—and by extension prevention of HPV. Because the
HPV vaccine was initially approved and introduced for
females only, there may be lingering confusion among
the public and health-care providers (HCPs) about its
value for males. In tandem, the absence of tailored messaging for men has played to stereotypes that men do not
engage self-health, a dominant discourse that can also
mislead HCPs about the need to expect yields from
actively promoting HPV vaccination in young men
(Salgado et al., 2019).


_Purpose for Current Scoping Review_


With HPV vaccination adherence rates unacceptably low
among college- and university-age males (18–26 years),
the purpose of this scoping review was to provide a synthesis of recent relevant literature on young males and
HPV vaccine as a means to guiding HCPs. Because the
vaccination for males was not approved by the FDA and
recommended by the National Advisory Committee on
Immunizations (NACI) until 2012, and the guidelines for
males did not extend through to age 26 until 2019
(Howard, 2019), the literature regarding how best to support and implement vaccine uptake within this population, is at best, emergent (Ratanasiripong, 2015; Salvadori,
2018). The vaccine is offered to males and females


_Laserson et al._ 3



starting in grade six (ages 11–12) in the United States and
Canada as part of routine vaccine schedule; however,
there is no regularly scheduled follow-up once they finish
high school and begin post-secondary education. In addition, there are inconsistencies across the U.S. states in
regard to school vaccine policies (National Conference
on State Legislatures (NCSL), 2020). After age 18, many
young men navigate their health independent of family,
making decisions on their own. Their estrangement from
health-care services has been well documented, especially in the context of sexual health and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening (Salgado et al., 2019).
Therefore, an important first step in creating an effective
intervention to increase HPV adherence is the exploration
of college- and university-age men’s practices, beliefs,
and decision-making processes regarding vaccinations
and health prevention. Understanding males’ (18–26
years) perceptions of HPV risk and screening is critical to
tailor clinical guidelines and raise awareness among men
and HCPs about the benefits of HPV vaccination
(Fontenot et al., 2014).


**Methods**


Scoping reviews are useful for producing knowledge syntheses about poorly understood health issues (Colquhoun
et al., 2014; Peterson et al., 2017). Differentiating from
systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the current scoping review includes diverse literature to point to emergent
empirical insights, knowledge gaps, and potential next
steps to advance male HPV vaccinations (Arksey &
O’Malley, 2005). In line with scoping review methods,
the literature was not formally evaluated or weighted in
terms of individual studies. Rather, empirical studies
were reviewed as a means to understand and contribute
recommendations for future research, education, practice,
and policy (Peterson et al., 2017). Guided by Arksey &
O’Malley (2005), five key stages were followed in the
current scope: (1) identifying the research question, (2)
identifying relevant studies, (3) relevant study selection,
(4) charting the data, and (5) collating, summarizing, and
reporting the results.
Guided by the research question “What are the facilitators and barriers to HPV vaccination adherence among
undergraduate U.S. and Canadian based college and university age males (18–26 years)?” Google Scholar,
MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases were searched using
the following keywords: papillomavirus vaccine, human
papillomavirus vaccine, HPV vaccine, college student(s),
university student(s), undergrad, men, male(s), young
adult(s), and student(s), male HPV related cancer. The
search terms were applied in a variety of combinations
using Boolean operators and MeSH subject headings.
Inclusion criteria included qualitative and quantitative



research articles published between 2015 and 2019 inclusive, written in English, and focused on male populations
or samples between the ages of 18 and 26 years.
In total, the searches returned 675 articles. Titles and
abstracts of each article were read and appraised for their
relevance to the topic and research question. Articles
reporting female or female and male aggregate results,
with their sample residing outside the United States and
Canada, and the age range of 18–26 years old were
excluded from the search results. Duplicate articles were
also removed, resulting in 15 articles that met the inclusion criteria.
Each of the 15 articles were analyzed by first reading
the article in full. To assist in organizing and classifying
principal aspects of each article, a matrix table was
developed by extracting the following elements: year of
publication, country of origin, study purpose, design/
methodology, population and sample size, and important
findings. The matrix provided a scaffold from which to
inductively derive the prevailing themes along with key
concepts identified across the studies (Table 1).
In categorizing the main findings of each study, three
key themes were identified and further analyses and
delineation of each were developed in the writing up of
the results. Theme one, _lack of awareness_, was underpinned by men’s knowledge deficits about their eligibility
for, and the availability of HPV vaccines. Theme two,
_underestimating and embodying risk_, included men’s
engagement in sexual activities while uninformed or
denying the risk for contracting HPV. The third theme,
_strategies for increasing men’s awareness_, summarizes
health messaging strategies used to lobby young men to
vaccinate.


_Results_


The 15 North American-based studies included in the
current scoping review consisted of the following methodologies: seven (46%) quantitative, four (27%) qualitative, and four (27%) mixed-methods. Thirteen (86%)
studies were conducted in the United States and two
(13%) in Canada.


_Lack of Awareness About HPV_


Lack of awareness regarding HPV and the HPV vaccine
was a consistent theme in over half the studies ( _n_ = 9;
60%). When asked about HPV and the vaccine, the results
consistently revealed significant knowledge deficits
wherein many men did not know the disease or vaccine
existed (Catalano et al., 2017; Fontenot et al., 2014;
Fuller & Hinyard, 2017; Grace-Leitch & Shneyderman,
2016; Hunter & Weinstein, 2016; Pitts et al., 2017; Priest
et al., 2015; Ratanasiripong, 2015; Tatar et al., 2017).

This lack of awareness and knowledge was the most commonly reported contributing factor for low vaccine rates
and high levels of HPV-related illness (Catalano et al.,
2017; Fontenot et al., 2014; Hunter & Weinstein, 2016;
Jones et al., 2016; Pitts et al., 2017; Priest et al., 2015;
Ratanasiripong, 2015; Tatar et al., 2017). For example,
Hunter and Weinstein (2016) noted that of those men surveyed, 35% ( _n_ = 40) indicated that they had never heard
of HPV and 51% ( _n_ = 59) indicated they were unaware
of the HPV vaccine before taking the survey. Among participants, 80% ( _n_ = 93) also indicated that they did not
know the HPV vaccine was available for men (Hunter &
Weinstein, 2016). Similarly, another study reported that
31.3% ( _n_ = 80) of the sample had never heard of HPV,
and 45.3% ( _n_ = 116) were unaware of the vaccine, even
though 86.3% ( _n_ = 221) reported having previously
engaged in oral, vaginal, and/or anal sex (Catalano et al.,
2017). Vaccine-related decision-making was correlated to
awareness and knowledge levels about the HPV infection
and negative health outcomes, as well as the existence of
the vaccine and its availability for men (Pitts et al., 2017;
Priest et al., 2015; Tatar et al., 2017).
Several studies indicated that although some participants had heard about HPV and the vaccine, when asked
specific questions regarding the disease and prevention,
significant knowledge deficits were evident (Pitts et al.,
2017; Priest et al., 2015). Similar results were reported in
a Canadian study wherein only 21.5% ( _n_ = 92) of respondents indicated being aware that most sexually active
people get HPV at some point in their lives; 29.9% ( _n_ =
128) knew that the HPV vaccine offered protection
against genital warts, and 32.7% ( _n_ = 140) were knowledgeable about the number of doses required to achieve
adequate protection (Tatar et al., 2017). These statistically significant results indicated only one-fifth of the
participants (19.46%, _n_ = 83) accurately categorized
themselves as having sufficient HPV knowledge (Tatar
et al., 2017).
Because HPV knowledge and awareness are so limited
in males, their understanding of the consequences of contracting HPV is also low (Fontenot et al., 2014). In one
study, only 56% of participants ( _n =_ 123) were able to
correctly identify issues related to HPV, indicating that
nearly half were unaware of the symptoms (or lack of
symptoms), consequences, and/or risks associated with
an HPV infection (Grace-Leitch & Shneyderman, 2016).
Several studies reported that little to no understanding
about HPV could lead to negative health complications
for men, an outcome directly associated with lack of STI
knowledge (Fontenot et al., 2014; Hunter & Weinstein,
2016; Priest et al., 2015; Tatar et al., 2017). In other
research that surveyed participants on their HPV knowledge, only 45% ( _n =_ 139) were aware that HPV can cause
cancer, and only 62% ( _n =_ 192) of participants were



aware that HPV could cause genital warts (Priest et al.,
2015). Similar findings were reported by Ratanasiripong
(2015); less than or approximately half the participants
( _n_ = 189) knew that HPV can cause anal cancer, and/or
genital warts, and be transmitted via skin-to-skin contact.
Widespread misperceptions of HPV including minimizing the severity and/or susceptibility in males have led to
a largely dismissive attitude to vaccination (Fontenot
et al., 2014).


_Underestimating and Embodying Risk_

Present in over half the articles ( _n_ = 9; 60%), underestimating risk was characterized by men’s lack of perceived
risk and susceptibility for contracting HPV. A common
misconception among college and university age men
was the belief they were not at risk for contracting HPV.
Many believed HPV affected females only (Fontenot
et al., 2014; Tatar et al., 2017). For example, the Tatar
(2017) study reported that 74.8% ( _n_ = 320) of respondents believed men could not contract HPV (Tatar et al.,
2017). Condom use, knowing their partners’ sexual history, and/or believing they had already been exposed to
HPV in the past were offered as risk-reducing and -protective factors by men (Fontenot et al., 2014). Among
Canadian men, 81.3% ( _n_ = 347) were aware that condom
use reduced HPV transmission (Tatar et al., 2017). Similar
results were identified in a U.S.-based study where 84%
( _n_ = 159) participants were aware that condoms provided
partial protection against HPV (Ratanasiripong, 2015).
The misconceptions that condoms provided full protection against HPV lead to underestimation of risk and
lower vaccine rates (Ratanasiripong, 2015; Tatar et al.,
2017). Among men with basic knowledge of HPV risk
factors (i.e., multiple sexual partners, not using condoms), 93% ( _n_ = 683) self-reported they were not at risk
for contracting an STI, illustrating a disconnect between
actual and perceived risk (Fontenot et al., 2014). Apathy
about, and dismissiveness toward, HPV and its health
implications were a commonly reported finding (Fontenot
et al., 2014; Pitts et al., 2017; Ratanasiripong, 2015). One
study indicated that 68.9% ( _n_ = 295) respondents
believed that HPV was a very rare disease (Tatar et al.,
2017). Male preconceptions of invincibility were also a
factor in the lack of preventative practices (Pitts et al.,
2017).
Young adult males (18–26 years) expressed the perspective that it was too late to get the vaccination given
their active sexual history, and believed they no longer
qualified to receive the vaccination, putting them at
increased risk (Pitts et al., 2017). Another barrier that
men reported was the stigma associated with STIs and the
perception that vaccination might be misconstrued as
treatment for HPV (Pitts et al., 2017). In other words,


_Laserson et al._ 7



stigma was a more potent influence than health risks for
many young men. Risk was also minimized when contraction of HPV was perceived as less serious than other
STIs (i.e., HIV; Fontenot et al., 2014; Pitts et al., 2017).
The role of media was cited as influencing some men’s
alignment to risky sexual behaviors and promiscuity in
tandem with the dismissal of the importance of HPV vaccine due to the information being presented and the lack
of male inclusion (Bonafide & Vanable, 2015; Perez
et al., 2015).


_Strategies for Increasing Men’s Awareness_


The pivotal role that HCPs can play in engaging and
encouraging HPV vaccine adherence was a common
finding in 53% ( _n_ = 8) studies (Bonafide & Vanable,
2015; Fontenot et al., 2014; Fuller & Hinyard, 2017;
Hunter & Weinstein, 2016; Lee et al., 2018; Priest et al.,
2015; Ratanasiripong, 2015; Tatar et al., 2017). In this
regard, HCPs played an integral role in both creating
awareness and education opportunities about HPV, and
administration of the HPV immunization. Even a simple
conversation with an HCP was reported to increase HPV
vaccine adherence in university- and college-age males
(Fuller & Hinyard, 2017; Hunter & Weinstein, 2016;
Tatar et al., 2017). In one study, 43% ( _n_ =24) students
who initiated discussion with an HCP received a positive
recommendation to vaccinate (Tatar et al., 2017). As male
adolescents become adults, however, the opportunity to
have these health-promoting conversations diminished
because routine health-care visits were low among young
men. Healthy young adult males were lost to routine
medical care and check-ups, and were therefore unlikely
to engage these types of conversations with their HCP
(Fontenot et al., 2014).
A major barrier to vaccine uptake reported in several
studies was simply that college-age men had never been
offered the vaccine by their HCPs (Bonafide & Vanable,
2015; Fontenot et al., 2014; Fuller & Hinyard, 2017;
Hunter & Weinstein, 2016). Among the 116 participants
in one study, only 6% ( _n_ = 7) indicated they had received
the HPV vaccine, all of whom stated that they were
informed about the vaccine by an HCP (Hunter &
Weinstein, 2016). Similar findings were reported in
another study in which 60.9% ( _n_ = 989) participants
indicated the most common reason for not receiving the
vaccine was that their HCP had not recommended it
(Fuller & Hinyard, 2017). Likewise, a Canadian study
indicated that 81% ( _n_ = 347) male participants (ages
18–26) had visited an HCP in the past year; however,
87% ( _n_ = 373) suggested that their HCP had never discussed the HPV vaccine with them (Tatar et al., 2017).
Lack of access to a regular HCP was listed as another
direct barrier to receiving education and ongoing



reminders about health preventative practices including
the HPV vaccine. In a U.S. study, 51% ( _n_ = 684) participants unvaccinated against HPV reported that they did
not have a primary HCP; whereas 72% ( _n_ = 203) of the
vaccinated participants reported that they did access an
HCP (Fuller & Hinyard, 2017). Men with a regular HCP
were almost two and half times more likely to have
received an HPV vaccine compared to those without an
HCP (Fuller & Hinyard, 2017). Most of the males who
received the vaccine (75%, _n =_ 207) also reported having
access to an HCP (Fuller & Hinyard, 2017). With collegeand university-age men being the subpopulation most
often without an HCP, providers should use every opportunity to enhance and educate young men on appropriate
self-care practices (Bonafide & Vanable, 2015). Despite
this important strategy in HPV vaccine adherence, studies
with HCPs have revealed that HCPs are more likely to
recommend the vaccine to female patients than male
patients (Lee et al., 2018), contributing to a significant
gender bias regarding HPV.
Conversations about preventative health behaviors at
an early age fostered normative beliefs about prevention
regarding safe sexual health practices. For example, a
U.S. study suggested that to enhance positive attitudes
toward HPV vaccination, interventions should focus on
behavioral beliefs of young males and this could be
achieved by frequent and early messaging both from parents and from sexual health education delivered by HCPs
(Ratanasiripong, 2015). Having a parent who held a graduate degree was significantly associated with the higher
odds of male child HPV vaccine completion (Lee et al.,
2018). In two studies, the age of the male was the only
significant demographic characteristic associated with
HPV vaccination (Fontenot et al., 2014; Ratanasiripong,
2015). On a continuous range from 18 to 25 years, there
were 24% lower odds of having obtained the HPV vaccine for every year these young men grew older (Fontenot
et al., 2014). These findings indicate the need to increase
HPV knowledge among parents and introduce health
education at earlier ages, and ideally these prevention
practices will carry forward into adulthood.
Several studies concluded that the communication of
altruism in conjunction with HPV information could
improve vaccination rates among males. When HPV
knowledge included the benefits to men’s partners and
broader health benefits at the global level, vaccine recommendations were more likely to be taken up (Bonafide &
Vanable, 2015). In a U.S. study, increased acceptance
occurred when participants were given information about
the HPV vaccine for males _plus_ altruistic motivations
compared to participants who received the male-focused
HPV information only (Bonafide & Vanable, 2015).
Altruistic motivation was identified in another study in
which men’s recognition of the broader social benefits of


8 _American Journal of Men’s Health_



HPV prevention for others was highlighted as a motivating factor to vaccinate (Pitts et al., 2017). A novel strategy was evaluated in a digital gaming randomized control
trial (RCT) designed to improve vaccine outcomes among
young male college participants; results demonstrated
how the use of customized avatars increased men’s risk
perception, self-efficacy, and behavior intention to
receive the vaccine (Darville et al., 2018).


**Discussion**


This scoping review was conducted to better understand
the facilitators and barriers to HPV vaccination adherence among U.S. and Canadian undergraduate collegeand university-age males (18–26 years), and to
recommend how HCPs can use this knowledge to guide
practice, influence change, and establish improved
men’s health promotion strategies. The chief areas identified in this review were men’s lack of awareness, their
underestimation of risk, and the need for male-focused
early intervention. However, given the complex history
and series of changes in vaccine policy recommendations for males, it is not surprising that the findings confirmed that men’s understanding of risk and overall
HPV knowledge was limited.
HCPs can focus on these areas to increase HPV vaccination rates among men. Perhaps the most important
finding in this review is the influence that HCPs carry
related to vaccine adherence. HCPs are well-positioned
to educate and advocate for the importance of the HPV
vaccine (Bonafide & Vanable, 2015; Fontenot et al.,
2014; Fuller & Hinyard, 2017; Hunter & Weinstein,
2016; Lee et al., 2018; Priest et al., 2015; Ratanasiripong,
2015; Tatar et al., 2017). There is consensus beyond this
review that vaccine adherence increases with HCP recommendations (Alexander et al., 2015; Allison et al.,
2016; Gerend et al., 2016). However, it is challenging to
define practice guidelines regarding the specific current
findings due to the wide-ranging variables influencing
diverse patient populations.
Standardized HPV education and information practices for HCPs are in progress. However, HCPs should
concentrate on repeated dissemination of information
about HPV and the vaccine at every relevant opportunity.
The most important reminder for HCPs when approaching this topic with patients and families is that the spectrum of readiness with adolescent sexual activity varies
greatly and information must be provided in a familycentered approach, with appropriate and careful consideration for the specific individuals (Money et al., 2007).
Professional organizations continue to reinforce that vaccination against HPV is the best primary prevention
method, and that screening for asymptomatic HPV infections is not possible because there is no validated test for



men (Money et al., 2007; Saslow et al., 2016). Guidelines
from the American Cancer Association reinforce the
notion that opportunities should be presented for young
men in college to be vaccinated, and that young adults
should not require parental consent to receive the HPV
vaccine.
Despite the influential role of HCPs in educating
males about the benefits of HPV vaccination, HCPs
often forfeit or miss those opportunities during consults (Cummings et al., 2015). Daley et al. (2017)
recounted the historical “feminization of HPV” and the
complicated guidelines, dosing schedules, and conflicting information from the FDA and Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for over
a decade. That complex history may have contributed
to vaccine gender biases among HCPs as well.
Complicating the role of the HCPs in vaccine compliance is the fact that increasingly many Americans and
Canadians are without a primary HCP. In Canada during 2016, 15.8% of citizens (approximately 4.8 million
people) over 12 years of age were without a primary
HCP. Significantly more males (19.9%) compared to
females (11.9%) were without a primary HCP, and
males 18–34 years old were more likely than any other
age group to be without a regular HCP (Statistics
Canada, 2016). Similar results have been noted in the
United States; 28% of men compared to 18% of women
over the age of 18 were without a regular HCP. Lack of
access and connectedness to HCPs for a significant
portion of the population implies that there is an
increased likelihood that HPV health messaging cannot be disseminated to college-age males.
Media plays an important role as a source of public
information about HPV. Because the HPV vaccine was initially framed as a female responsibility, publicly funded for
women only with advertising explicitly targeting females,
public health campaigns are playing catch-up to recalibrate
messaging to include males. Two significant findings from
this review could be incorporated into health promotions
messaging and HCP discussions. First, changing attitudes
toward HPV vaccination and gender norms can significantly predict intentions to vaccinate (Ratanasiripong,
2015). If education about HPV and sexual health starts at a
young age, positive values and practices toward sexual
health and STI prevention can result in increased vaccine
adherence. Second, findings suggested that stressing both
the male-specific health benefits as well as altruistic
motives such as protecting others by vaccinating can
improve male receptivity to vaccination. Advertising campaigns, public health messaging, school vaccination programs, and HCP consults may achieve greater impact on
male vaccine adherence by pairing these ideas (Bonafide
& Vanable, 2015). The role of altruism in young men’s
health has been confirmed in other research. A Canadian


_Laserson et al._ 9



study investigating masculine norms in relation to health
care reported that young men (ages 15–29) consider putting the welfare of others ahead of their own to be a deeply
valued positive masculine behavior (Oliffe et al., 2019).
The use of video gaming to creatively deliver messaging
about HPV to young college-age men also plays to normative masculinities and values such as competitiveness, promoting behavior intent to receive the vaccine (Darville
et al., 2018).
The most common misconceptions were perceptions
that young men believed it was too late to be vaccinated
and that HPV only affects women. This misinformation
illustrated the lack of understanding about perceived
timing, risk, and the severity of HPV-related illness
(Hunter & Weinstein, 2016; Pitts et al., 2017; Priest
et al., 2015; Ratanasiripong, 2015). The lack of perceived risk (Fontenot et al., 2014; Hunter & Weinstein,
2016; Pask & Rawlins, 2016) was directly related to
both lack of awareness and the well-documented
absence of sexual health-seeking behaviors typically
seen in young males (Salgado et al., 2019). Lack of
HPV knowledge combined with high-risk sexual behaviors in late adolescence and early adulthood highlight
the need for health promotion strategies to prevent lifechanging illnesses (Crocker et al., 2019). Communitybased health promotion programs need to be tailored
specifically to young men’s needs and counter normative beliefs and misperceptions about risk.
In order to enhance positive attitudes toward HPV
vaccine adherence, interventions altering behavioral and
beliefs (e.g., having anogenital cancer is negative and
getting the vaccine protects men from serious illness) can
enhance and transform subjective norms (Ratanasiripong,
2015). HCPs can develop educational programs to
increase patient education and awareness about HPV;
evaluate current health center policies and procedures to
assess for known barriers; and support an environment
that promotes vaccination (Fontenot et al., 2014).
Although educating males on the risks of HPV is vital,
the focus of interventions should not be on the severity of
HPV; heightened perceptions of HPV severity can lead to
higher HPV-related stigma, which in turn may act as a
barrier to vaccination (Jones et al., 2016). Stigma is a
more influential barrier to vaccine adherence when participants are in early stages of HPV vaccine decisionmaking, namely “unaware” (Jones et al., 2016). Health
promotion campaigns should focus on educational facts
of HPV without fueling stigmas or anxieties surrounding
HPV. Information presented to college-age men should
emphasize that although the vaccine is most effective
with the series completed prior to sexual debut, the vaccine continues to be beneficial as a preventative measure
even after a person has engaged in sexual activities (Pitts
et al., 2017).



Due to extended approval of the vaccine for men, there
needs to be a significant shift in how information is presented to college- and university-age men (18–26;
Catalano et al., 2017; Fontenot et al., 2014; Hunter &
Weinstein, 2016; Pitts et al., 2017; Priest et al., 2015).
Masculine values as they pertain to male health care are
highly relevant for a disease and treatment that have previously been highly feminized. This pivot in public health
policy may explain why the current review reported that
significant barriers to vaccination were male perceptions
of the HPV vaccination as feminine, and therefore not
applicable and perhaps stigmatizing.
Gendered health behaviors are learned and may be
socialized in men from an early age, reinforced during
adolescence, and amplified in early adulthood (Crocker
et al., 2019). Studies have demonstrated that aligning to
traditional masculine norms predicts men’s low rates of
engagement in preventative health behaviors, such as
routine medical exams, self-care practices, and psychological help (Salgado et al., 2019). Men who do disclose engaging in sexual health promoting practices
risk being characterized as “feminine” or “weak”
(Salgado et al., 2019). Often, male-biased stereotypes
may alter the HCP’s perception of how men receive
information, and they may withhold discussions about
HPV that otherwise may have been well received. For
example, female physicians have been reported to provide patients with more preventive and counseling services than male physicians (Bertakis, 2009). Dominant
expressions of traditional masculinity, such as competitiveness, risk-taking, self-reliance, stoicism, and being
perceived as heterosexual, are still widespread, and
these norms encourage men to restrict self-protective
health behaviors (Salgado et al., 2019). To counter masculine stereotypes, health promotion programs should
focus on young men’s susceptibility to HPV and work
to shift normative behaviors around sexual health
(Grace-Leitch & Shneyderman, 2016). Health messaging should target men on college campuses, especially
in light of findings indicating that increased knowledge
and perception of HPV susceptibility improved vaccine
acceptability among young men. Future research should
aim to understand how messaging impacts vaccine
acceptance and adherence, including among males who
do not identify with “stereotypical” masculine norms
(Bonafide & Vanable, 2015; Lee et al., 2018).


_Limitations_


This review is intended to guide practice for HCPs; however, there are several key limitations. The major limitation in this set of articles is that all but one ( _n_ = 14) of the
included studies (Fuller & Hinyard, 2017) gathered participants directly from post-secondary institutions. This


10 _American Journal of Men’s Health_



sampling method limits the findings in terms of understanding males who may not be attending conventional
post-secondary institutions (i.e., college or university)
and/or those from low socioeconomic backgrounds considered at high risk for contracting HPV, but who may
not be afforded the same level of health promotion and
prevention opportunities. The second limitation is that
all the included studies were comprised exclusively of
male samples. The absence of female perspectives creates a potentially segregated view of HPV, when in reality, HPV prevention needs to focus on genders equally,
equitably, and relationally. Future work should focus on
combined male and female strategies within college and
university age ranges to decrease barriers. Such targeting
is essential to creating a broader understanding and
increasing the likelihood of a population effect on HPV
vaccine adherence rates.


**Conclusion**


Because the HPV vaccine recommendations were repeatedly updated for males over the last 10 years, evidence is
still emerging on how best to increase vaccine adherence.
With rates of HPV-related illnesses on the rise, strategies
to mitigate this growing health concern must be established quickly in order to decrease related illness and
deaths. The focus must be on health promotion and prevention approaches geared specifically to males. Norming
male HPV vaccinations is key, and the work of that
clearly resides with men and HCPs, parents, partners, and
public health in redressing the gendered history that
estranged men in the first place.
