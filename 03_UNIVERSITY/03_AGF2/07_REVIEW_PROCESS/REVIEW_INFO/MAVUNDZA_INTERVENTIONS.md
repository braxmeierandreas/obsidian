**Abstract:** Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection
worldwide. Although most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, persistent infection with
high-risk HPV types may results in diseases. Although there are currently three effective and safe
prophylactic HPV vaccines that are used across the world, HPV vaccination coverage remains low.
This review evaluates the effects of the interventions to improve HPV vaccination coverage. We
searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and the
World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and checked the reference
lists of relevant articles for eligible studies. Thirty-five studies met inclusion criteria. Our review
found that various evaluated interventions have improved HPV vaccination coverage, including
narrative education, outreach plus reminders, reminders, financial incentives plus reminders, brief
motivational behavioral interventions, provider prompts, training, training plus assessment and
feedback, consultation, funding, and multicomponent interventions. However, the evaluation of these
intervention was conducted in high-income countries, mainly the United States of America. There is,
therefore, a need for studies to evaluate the effect of these interventions in low-and middle-income
countries, where there is a high burden of HPV and limited HPV vaccination programs.

**1. Introduction**


Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted
infection worldwide [1]. It is estimated that 75% of sexually active men and women will
acquire HPV infection in their lifetime. HPV infections are most prevalent in young adults,
as sexual risk behaviors are greatest in this age group. Sexually active young women, in
particular, carry the highest risk of infection, with studies documenting rates as high as
68–71% [2]. To date, more than 200 HPV types have been identified and classified into
two groups: high-risk and low-risk types [3]. Although most HPV infections are transient
and asymptomatic, persistent infection with high-risk HPV types may result in cancers,
including cervical, anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers [4–6], and
genital warts [6]. High-risk HPV types, including HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51,

-52, -56, -58, and -59 are associated with cancers in humans, whereas low-risk HPV types,
including HPV-6, -11, -40, -42, -43, -44, -54, -61, and -72 cause benign diseases such as
genital warts [7]. Among these HPV types, the majority of HPV-related clinical diseases
are associated with HPV-16, -18, -6, and -11. HPV types 16 and 18 cause approximately
70% of cervical cancer, and HPV-6 and HPV-11 are responsible for approximately 90% of
genital warts. Most HPV-associated morbidity and mortality is due to cervical cancer, the
fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, with an estimated 604,127 cases and
341,831 deaths in 2020 [8]. HPV vaccination is an important tool to prevent and control
HPV infection and its complications [5]. There are currently three prophylactic HPV
vaccines that are used across the world: Cervarix, a bivalent HPV vaccine that targets HPV16 and -18; Gardasil, a quadrivalent HPV vaccine that targets HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18; and
Gardasil 9, a nonavalent HPV vaccine that targets HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -45, -52, and
-58 [9]. All three vaccines have proven to be highly efficacious against persistent infection
of their vaccine genotypes. However, HPV vaccines are most effective when administered
before debut and exposure to HPV [10]. HPV vaccination is currently recommended for
adolescent males and females aged 9–14 years in a two-dose series and as a three-dose
series for young men and women aged 15–26 years [11].
Despite its effectiveness, safety, and recommendations, HPV vaccination coverage
remains low. Numerous barriers to HPV vaccination have been identified, including lack of
health care provider recommendations, concerns about safety, concerns about side effects,
and a general lack of awareness and knowledge about HPV vaccination [12]. There is,
therefore, an urgent need for effective interventions to improve HPV vaccination coverage
and reduce the burden of HPV-associated infections and cancers. Several reviews have
assessed interventions to improve HPV vaccination coverage. However, the reviews
assessed the effectiveness of interventions among adolescents [13], young adults [14],
adolescents and young adults [15], the effectiveness of practice- and community-based
interventions [6], and communication technology interventions [16]. A comprehensive
systematic review on interventions to increase HPV vaccination coverage was published
in 2016 [17]. However, the review included only studies conducted in the United States
of America. Therefore, this review’s findings may not be applicable to low- and middleincome countries, where the burden of HPV is high, and vaccination coverage is very
low. In addition, the review included only studies up to 2015, while there have been
numerous potentially eligible studies published since then. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no comprehensive systematic review that has assessed interventions to improve
HPV vaccination coverage across all country income categories. These limitations justify
the need for a comprehensive systematic review on the interventions to improve HPV
vaccination coverage.


**2. Materials and Methods**


The protocol for this review was registered in the International Prospective Register
of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42019138971) [18], and the review was prepared
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guideline [19].


_2.1. Criteria for Considering Studies for This Review_


We included randomized trials, non-randomized trials, interrupted time-series studies,
and controlled before–after studies that met the quality criteria used by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) [20]. We only included cluster-randomized
controlled trials with at least two intervention and two control clusters. Interrupted timeseries studies were only included if their outcomes were measured during at least three
points before and after the intervention. We also included controlled before–after studies
only if they had at least two intervention groups and at least two comparable control
groups. We included studies conducted among all individuals eligible for HPV vaccines
and their parents/legal guardians or healthcare providers. Included studies evaluated


_Vaccines_ **2021**, _9_, 687 3 of 30


recipient-oriented, provider-oriented, legislative, health system, and multi-component
interventions. Eligible studies compared the interventions to standard HPV vaccination
practices, alternative interventions, or similar interventions implemented with different
degrees of intensity. Our primary outcome of interest was HPV vaccination coverage, while
our secondary outcomes were adverse effects and the cost of the intervention.


_2.2. Search Methods for Identification of Studies_


We developed a comprehensive search strategy with the help of an information specialist. We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. We searched databases from inception
until the day of the search. We searched for published articles with no language restriction.
We provided the search strategies for databases searched (Appendix A, Table A1). We also
searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and
the reference lists of included studies and related reviews for other relevant studies. In
addition, we searched the abstracts of the latest conferences of relevant scientific societies
related to vaccination and HPV virology for new or pending information not yet published
in peer-reviewed journals.


_2.3. Selection of Studies_


Two review authors (Edison Mavundza [EM] and Chinwe Iwu-Jaja [CI]) independently screened the titles and abstracts to identify potentially eligible studies. Disagreements between the two authors were resolved by discussion and consensus. We obtained
the full texts of all potentially eligible studies. Two authors independently screened the
full texts and identified included studies, resolving discrepancies through discussion and
consensus. Excluded studies are described in the table of excluded studies alongside their
reasons for exclusion.


_2.4. Data Extraction and Management_


Two review authors (EM and CI) independently extracted data from each included
study using a structured and standardized data extraction form. Extracted data included
study setting, type of study, type of participants, type of intervention, type of comparator,
and type of outcomes measured. Differences between the two review authors were resolved
by discussion and consensus.


_2.5. Assessment of Risk of Bias in Included Studies_


Two review authors (EM and CI) independently assessed the risk of bias within
each included study by addressing seven specific domains, namely, random sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of
outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and “other
issues” [21]. For each included study, the two review authors independently described
what the study authors reported that they did for each domain and then made a decision
relating to the risk of bias for that domain by assigning a judgement of “low risk” of bias,
“high risk” of bias, or “unclear risk” of bias. The review authors compared the results of
their independent assessments of risk of bias and resolved any discrepancies by discussion
and consensus.


**3. Results**
_3.1. Results of the Search_


The search yielded 3936 records. After removing 1078 duplicates, 2858 titles and abstracts were screened, and 2764 were not relevant. We reviewed the remaining 94 potentially
eligible full-text articles for inclusion; 49 met our inclusion criteria, and we excluded
45 articles. The 49 included publications reported data on 35 studies. The 45 excluded
articles reported data on 38 studies. The process used for the search and selection of studies
for this review is described in Figure 1.

_3.2. Description of Studies_


The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Appendix A, Table A2.


3.2.1. Study Design and Setting


Thirty-two studies were randomized trials [22–53], two studies were controlled before–
after studies [54,55], and one study was a non-randomized trial [56]. Thirty-two studies
were conducted in the USA [22–35,37,39–48,50–56]. The remaining three studies were
carried out in the UK [36], the Netherlands [38], and Australia [49].


_Vaccines_ **2021**, _9_, 687 5 of 30


3.2.2. Participants


Seven studies were conducted among females only [22,24,27,33,36,37,51]; one study was conducted among males only [41]; one study was conducted among males and females [43]; thirteen
studies were conducted among parents/ guardians [25,31,32,34,38–40,42,44,45,47,49,56]; nine
studies were conducted among providers [23,28–30,46,52–55]. The remaining four studies
were conducted among mixed participants: adolescents and parents/guardians [35,48,50]
and young adults and parents/guardians [26].


3.2.3. Interventions and Comparators


Twenty-six studies assessed recipient-oriented interventions [22,24–27,31–45,47–51,56].
The remaining nine studies assessed provider-oriented interventions [23,28–30,46,52–55].
Comparators ranged from the standard of care in each setting to alternative interventions.


3.2.4. Outcome Measures


All included studies reported data on our primary outcome, HPV vaccination
coverage. Twenty-two studies reported data on the initiation of the HPV vaccine
series [22,23,25,27–37,39,41,44,48,53–56]. Nineteen studies reported data on the completion
of HPV vaccine series [22,24,25,27,30,34,36,40–44,46,48,51,52,54–56]. Four studies reported
data on the receipt of any HPV vaccine dose [26,38,49,50].
Only four studies reported data on our pre-specified secondary outcomes. Three
studies reported data on the cost of the intervention strategies [25,45,47], and one study
reported data on adverse effects of the intervention [44].


3.2.5. Excluded Studies


Thirty-eight studies were excluded for reasons described in the characteristics of
excluded studies (Appendix A, Table A3).


3.2.6. Risk of Bias in Included Studies


The risk of bias in the included studies is summarized in Appendix A, Table A4.
Below, we briefly describe the risk related to sequence generation, allocation concealment,
blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective reporting, and other potential biases.
The risk of bias linked to the adequacy of the generation of the randomization sequence
was low for twenty-two studies [22,23,25–28,32–34,36,37,39–41,44–49,51,52], unclear for
ten studies [24,29–31,35,38,42,43,50,53], and high for two studies [55,56].
The risk of bias resulting from the adequacy of allocation concealment was low for
five studies [22,27,37,46,47], unclear for fourteen studies [23,24,26,28–31,35,38,41–43,50,53],
and high for fifteen studies [25,32–34,36,39,40,44,45,48,49,51,52,55,56].
The risk of bias linked to the adequacy of blinding of participants and research personnel was low for thirteen studies [22,26,32,39,42,43,45,47–49,51–53], unclear for thirteen studies [24,25,30,31,33,35–37,40,46,50,55,56], and high for eight studies [23,27–29,34,38,41,44].
The risk of bias related to the blinding of outcome assessors was low for four studies [24,26,32,40], unclear for twenty-six studies [22,25,27–31,33,36,37,39,42–53,55,56], and
high for four studies [23,34,38,41].
The risk of bias linked to the completeness of outcome data was low for twenty-five
studies [23,24,27–37,40,41,43–46,48–53], unclear for three studies [25,47,55], and high for
six studies [22,26,38,39,42,56].
We did not find evidence of reporting bias or other biases beyond the ones reported above.


_3.3. Effects of Interventions_
3.3.1. Recipient-Oriented Interventions
Comparison 1: Tailored Education Compared to Standard of Care


Three studies assessed the effect of HPV-tailored education compared to the standard
of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The studies showed that HPV-tailored
education had no effect on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86


_Vaccines_ **2021**, _9_, 687 6 of 30


to 1.17; 1350 participants) [22,27,48]. We judged the certainty of the evidence as very
low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included studies and serious
imprecision in the findings.
Three studies assessed the effect of HPV-tailored education compared to the standard
of care on the completion of the HPV vaccine series. Meta-analysis of data from these three
studies showed that tailored education improved the completion of HPV vaccination series
(RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77; I [2] = 27%; 880 participants) [22,27,51]. We downgraded the
certainty of the evidence to low because of study limitations (i.e., a high risk of bias in
all studies).
Two studies assessed the impact of tailored education compared to the standard of care
on receipt of any dose of the HPV vaccine. The study showed that tailored education had
no effect on uptake of HPV vaccine (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 8931 participants) [26,38].
We judged the certainty of the evidence as very low because of concerns regarding the risk
of bias in the included studies and serious imprecision in the findings.
The studies reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 2: Tailored Education Compared to Untailored Education


One study assessed the effect of tailored education compared to untailored education
on receipt of any dose of HPV vaccine. The study showed untailored education had a slight
effect on uptake of HPV vaccine compared to the tailored education intervention (RR 0.97,
95% CI 0.80 to 1.19; 855 participants) [26]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to
very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included study and serious
imprecision in the findings.
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 3: Narrative Education Compared to Non-Narrative Education


Two studies showed that narrative education improved the initiation of the HPV
vaccination series compared to non-narrative education (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.00;
I [2] = 24%; 728 participants) [33,35]. We judged the certainty of the evidence as very low
because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included studies and very serious
imprecision in the findings.
The studies reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 4: Multicomponent Education Compared to Standard of Care


A study showed that a multicomponent HPV education led to a very small decrease
in the uptake of HPV vaccine compared to the standard of care (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87 to
1.11; 2912 participants) [50]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low because
of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included study and serious imprecision in
the findings.
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 5: Outreach Plus Reminders Compared to Standard of Care


One study assessed the impact of outreach plus reminders compared to the standard
of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The study showed that the intervention improved the initiation of the HPV vaccine series (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.60;
1624 participants) [31]. We judged the certainty of the evidence as moderate because of an
unclear risk of bias in the included study.
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 6: Outreach Plus Education Compared to Standard of Care


A study assessed the impact of education and outreach compared to the standard of
care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The study reported that 84% of participants
in both groups (Brochure only and _Entre Madre e Hija_ (EMH)) initiated HPV vaccination, and
no differences were observed between EMH program and brochure-only participants [56].


_Vaccines_ **2021**, _9_, 687 7 of 30


We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate because of study limitations
(i.e., non-randomized study).
One study assessed the impact of education and outreach compared to standard of
care on the completion of the HPV vaccine series. The study showed that the intervention improved the completion of the HPV vaccine series (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.22;
288 participants) [56]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate because
of study limitations (i.e., non-randomized study).
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 7: Education Plus Reminders Compared to Standard of Care


A study assessed the effect of education plus reminders compared to the standard
of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The study showed that the intervention improved the initiation of the HPV vaccine series (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.76;
150 participants) [41]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low because of
study limitations, as the included study had a high risk of bias.
Another study assessed the impact of HPV education plus reminders compared to
the standard of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The study showed that
the intervention was significantly associated with HPV vaccine uptake (RR: 0.84; 95% CI:
0.31–2.28) [37]. We judged the certainty of the evidence as very low because of concerns
regarding the risk of bias in the included study and serious imprecision in the findings.
Three studies assessed the impact of HPV education plus reminders compared to the
standard of care on the completion of the HPV vaccine series. A meta-analysis of data
from these three studies showed that the intervention improved the completion of the
HPV vaccine series (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.51; I [2] = 28%; 6711 participants) [41–43]. We
downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of concerns regarding the
risk of bias in the included studies and serious imprecision in the findings.
The studies reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 8: Reminders vs. Standard of Care


Three studies assessed the effect of a reminder compared to the standard of care
on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. Two studies showed that the intervention
improved the initiation of the HPV vaccine series (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.18; I [2] = 40%;
166,264 participants) [25,39]. We judged the certainty of the evidence as low because of
study limitations, as the included studies had a high risk of bias.
Suh (2012) [45] reported that 26.5% of female adolescents initiated HPV vaccine series
in the intervention group compared to 15.3% in the control group. We judged the certainty
of the evidence as low because of study limitations, as the included studies had a high risk
of bias.
Four studies assessed the effect of reminders compared to the standard of care on the
completion of the HPV vaccine series. The study showed that intervention improved the
completion of the HPV vaccination series (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.29; I [2] = 63%; 175,743 participants) [24,25,40,48]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because
of concerns regarding the risk of bias and serious inconsistency in the included studies.
Tull (2019) [49] assessed the effect of reminders compared to the standard of care on
the uptake of any HPV dose. The study found that the intervention had no effect on the
uptake of HPV vaccine (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 5912 participants). We judged the
certainty of the evidence as moderate because of a high risk of bias in the included study.
Three studies measured the costs of the intervention [25,45,47]. Coley (2018) [25]
calculated the reminder mailing and vaccination costs. The mailing costs were $13,698 for
address verification, $44,312 for printing, and $57,991 for postage. The vaccination cost was
$30.95 per adolescent who initiated the HPV vaccine series. Szilagyi (2013) [47] measured
the cost of the intervention on pertussis, meningococcal, and HPV vaccination among adolescents. The delivery cost of the intervention was $18.78 for mailed and $16.68 for phone
reminders per adolescent per year, respectively. The cost per additional fully vaccinated


_Vaccines_ **2021**, _9_, 687 8 of 30


adolescent was $463.99 for mailed and $714.98 for telephone reminders. Suh (2012) [45]
calculated the total operating cost of reminder/recall intervention per additional adolescent
who received tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, meningococcal conjugate, or a first
dose of human papillomavirus vaccine in four practices. The total operating cost, which
included personnel and supply costs, ranged between $1087 and $1349.


Comparison 9: Educational Reminders Compared to Plain Reminders


Hofstetter (2017) [32] showed that educational reminders improve the initiation of
the HPV vaccination series compared to plain reminders (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.06;
90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of
concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included study and serious imprecision in
the findings.
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 10: Financial Incentives Plus Reminders Compared to Standard of Care


One study assessed the impact of financial incentives plus reminders compared
to the standard of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The study showed
that intervention improved the initiation of the HPV vaccine series (RR 1.73, 95% CI
1.34 to 2.24; I [2] = 64%; 1000 participants) [36]. We judged the certainty of the evidence
as very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included study and
serious inconsistency.
A study assessed the impact of financial incentives plus reminders compared to the
standard of care on the completion of the HPV vaccine series. The study showed that
intervention improved the initiation of the HPV vaccine series (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.26 to
2.63; I [2] = 0%; 1000 participants) [36]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low
because of a high risk of bias in the included study.
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 11: Brief Motivational Behavioral Intervention Compared to Standard of Care


One study assessed the impact of the brief motivational behavioral intervention
compared to the standard of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The study
showed that intervention improved initiation of the HPV vaccine series (RR 1.10, 95%
CI 0.85 to 1.43; 200 participants) [34]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to
very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included study and serious
imprecision in the findings.
A study assessed the impact of the brief motivational behavioral intervention compared to the standard of care on the completion of the HPV vaccine series. The study
showed that intervention improved the completion of HPV vaccine series (RR 1.73, 95%
CI 0.66 to 4.59; 200 participants) [34]. We judged the certainty of the evidence as very
low, because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included studies and serious
imprecision in the findings.
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 12: Brief Health Messaging Using Different Formats


One study assessed the effect of brief health messaging on the initiation of the HPV
vaccine series. The study reported that rhetorical questions did not increase the initiation
of the HPV vaccine series (RR = 1.15, CI 0.89, 1.50). One-sided and two-sided messages
also had no effect on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series [44]. We downgraded the
certainty of the evidence to very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the
included study and serious imprecision in the findings.
A study assessed the effect of brief health messaging on the completion of the HPV
vaccine series. The study reported that rhetorical questions and message sidedness had no
significant effect on the completion of the HPV vaccine series [44]. We judged the certainty


_Vaccines_ **2021**, _9_, 687 9 of 30


of the evidence as very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included
studies and serious imprecision in the findings.
Rickert (2015) evaluated the adverse events of the intervention, but none occurred.


3.3.2. Provider-Oriented Intervention
Comparison 13: Prompts Compared to Standard of Car


One study assessed the impact of provider prompts compared to the standard of care on
the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The study showed that provider prompts improved
the initiation of the HPV vaccine series (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.54; 925 participants) [53]. We
downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate because of study limitations, as the
included study had an unclear risk of bias.
Two studies assessed the effect of provider prompts compared to the standard of
care on the completion of the HPV vaccine series. The study showed that intervention improved the completion of the HPV vaccine series (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.19;
I [2] = 72%; 3056 participants) [46,52]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to
very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included studies and
serious inconsistency.
The studies reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 14: Provider Training Compared to Standard of Care


A study assessed the effect of provider announcement and conversation training
compared to the standard of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The study
reported that clinics that received announcement training had increases in HPV vaccine
initiation coverage that exceeded control clinics’ increases (5.4% difference, 95% CI 1.1
to 9.7). Clinics that received conversation training did not differ from the control arm
on uptake for HPV vaccine initiation (all _P_ s > 0.05) [23]. We judged the certainty of the
evidence as very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included studies
and serious imprecision in the findings.
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 15: Provider Training Plus Assessment and Feedback Compared to Wait
List Control


One study assessed the impact of provider training plus assessment and feedback
intervention compared to wait list control on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The
study showed that initiation of the HPV vaccine series rates increased by 10.2 percentage
points in the intervention arm and 6.9 percentage points in the control arm [29]. We
downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of concerns regarding the
risk of bias in the included studies and very serious imprecision in the findings.
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 16: Assessment and Feedback Compared to Standard of Care Series


Irving (2018) [54] evaluated the effect of assessment and feedback intervention compared to the standard of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series among adolescent
boys and girls aged 11–17 years. The study reported that there was no significant difference in the initiation of the HPV vaccine series between intervention and control clinics.
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of study limitations
(i.e., before–after study).
One study evaluated the effect of assessment and feedback intervention compared
to the standard of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series among adolescent
boys and girls aged 11–17 years [54]. The study found that the completion of the HPV
vaccine series between the intervention and control clinics was not significantly different.
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of study limitations
(i.e., before–after study).
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.

Comparison 17: Provider Consultation Compared to Standard of Care


A study assessed the effect of in-person and webinar-delivered Assessment, Feedback,
Incentives, and eXchange (AFIX) consultations compared to standard of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. The study reported that participants served by clinics in the
in-person arm had uptake that exceed those in the control arm for HPV vaccine initiation
(1.5% (95% CI: 0.3 to 2.7)). Participants served by clinics in the webinar versus control arms
also had larger coverage increases for HPV vaccine initiation (1.9 (95% CI: 0.7 to 3.1)) [28].
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of concerns regarding
the risk of bias in the included study and very serious imprecision in the findings.
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 18: Funding Compared to Training and Technical Assistance


One study compared the effect of $90,000 (2-year grant fund), $10,000 (3-month grant
fund), and training and technical assistance on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series
among patients aged 11–12 years. The study found that initiation of the HPV vaccine series
rates increased by 18.4, 14.6, and 11.1 percentage points in the $90,000 grant fund, training
and technical assistance, and $10,000 grant fund, respectively [30]. We judged the certainty
of the evidence as low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included study
and serious imprecision in the findings.
A study compared the effect of $90,000 (2-year grant fund), $10,000 (3-month grant
fund), and training and technical assistance on the completion of the HPV vaccine series
among patients aged 11–12 years. The study reported that completion of HPV vaccine
series rates increased only in the $90,000 grant fund by 5 percentage points and decreased
by 4.5 and 1.7 percentage points in the $10,000 grant fund and training and technical
assistance arm, respectively [30]. We judged the certainty of the evidence as low because
of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included study and serious imprecision in
the findings.
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


Comparison 19: Multicomponent Intervention Compared Standard of Care


One study assessed the impact of a multicomponent intervention compared to the
standard of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series among adolescents aged 11–12
and 13–17 years. Among adolescents aged 11–12 years, HPV vaccine series initiation rates
increased by 18.7 percentage points in the intervention arm and 12.6 percentage points
in the control arm, whereas, among adolescents aged 13–17 years, the rates increased
by 8.7 percentage points in the intervention arm and 7 percentage points in the control
arm [55]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of study
limitations (i.e., before–after study).
A study assessed the impact of a multicomponent intervention compared to the
standard of care on the completion of the HPV vaccine series among adolescents aged
11–12 and 13–17 years. HPV vaccine series completion rates among adolescents aged
11–12 years increased by the same 20.7 percentage points both in the intervention and
control arms, whereas, among adolescents aged 13–17 years, the completion rates increased
by 12.5 percentage points in the intervention and 11.9 percentage points in the control
arms [55]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of study
limitations (i.e., before–after study).
The study reported no relevant secondary outcomes.


**4. Discussion**


Our study found that recipient-oriented interventions that improved the initiation
of the HPV vaccine series were narrative education, reminders, outreach plus reminders,
education plus reminders, financial incentives plus reminders, and brief motivational
behavioral interventions. We also found that the recipient-oriented interventions that
improved the completion of the HPV vaccine series were tailored education, outreach


_Vaccines_ **2021**, _9_, 687 11 of 30


and education, education plus reminders, reminders in general, financial incentives plus
reminders, and brief motivational behavioral interventions. Tailored education, outreach
and education, and brief health messaging were recipient-oriented interventions that had
no effect on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series. Brief health messaging was also found
to be a recipient-oriented intervention that had no effect on the completion of the HPV
vaccine series. The provider-oriented interventions that improved the initiation of the HPV
vaccine series were prompts, training, training plus assessment and feedback, consultation,
funding **,** and multicomponent interventions. Prompts, funding and multicomponent were
also found to be provider-oriented interventions that improved the completion of HPV
vaccine series. Assessment and feedback were provider-oriented interventions that had no
effect on both the initiation and the completion of the HPV vaccine series. With regards
to the improvement of uptake of any HPV vaccine dose, all assessed recipient-oriented
interventions, tailored education, untailored education, multicomponent education, and
reminders did not have any effect.
Our systematic review was comprehensive. We included all known types of interventions, including recipient- and provider-oriented interventions, and all country settings.
Our comprehensive search resulted in 35 studies that met our inclusion criteria. However,
all studies were conducted in high-income countries, mainly the USA, where the burden
of HPV is relatively low. None of the included studies were conducted in low-income
countries, where the burden of HPV is very high. Therefore, the findings of these studies
may be applicable only in the settings of the high-income countries. Another limitation is
that there is very small number of studies that reported data on our secondary outcomes.
Among the included studies, there were only one and three studies that reported data on
the adverse effects and the cost of the interventions, respectively. However, because of
variations in the measures of costs between the three studies, we were unable to conduct a
meta-analysis. One study that reported on the adverse effects of the intervention stated
that there were no effects documented in the study. Given that there is insufficient data on
adverse effects and costs of the interventions, there is an urgent need for more studies to
address these gaps. In addition, these studies should be well-designed and should evaluate
outcomes and report results in ways that will allow the clear assessment of the cost and
adverse effects of the interventions.
Thirty-five studies were excluded in this review mainly based on the methods used to
conduct them. In addition, most of these studies were published after 2015, the period in
which a previous similar review by Smulian (2016) [17] included studies up to. We may
therefore have missed important findings from these studies. Well-designed studies that
assess the effect of the interventions on HPV vaccination coverage are needed.
We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE)approach to assess the certainty of the evidence on the effects of the included
interventions on HPV vaccination coverage. Among the recipient-oriented interventions
that improved HPV vaccination coverage, we judged the certainty of the evidence as moderate for outreach plus reminders, low for reminders, and very low for education, financial
incentives plus reminders, and brief motivational behavioral interventions. Regarding
provider-oriented interventions that improved HPV vaccination coverage, we judged the
certainty of the evidence as moderate for provider prompts, low for funding, and very
low for training, consultation, training plus assessment and feedback, consultation, and
multicomponent interventions. Overall, the certainty of evidence of interventions that
improved HPV vaccination coverage was very low to moderate. Our main concerns with
the evidence related to study limitations: risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision in
the studies. There is, therefore, an urgent need for well-designed, well-implemented, and
well-reported studies to increase the certainty of the current evidence. We minimized potential biases in the review process by adhering to the Cochrane guidelines for conducting
a systematic review [21]. We conducted comprehensive searches of both peer-reviewed and
grey literature, without limiting the searches to a specific language. Two review authors


_Vaccines_ **2021**, _9_, 687 12 of 30


independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in
each included study. We are not aware of any biases in the review process.
Several systematic reviews have assessed the effectiveness of interventions for improving HPV vaccination coverage [6,13–17,57]. Smulian (2016) [17] evaluated the effectiveness
of the interventions for improving HPV vaccination coverage in USA. The review found
that many types of intervention strategies (targeting recipients, providers, and the health
system) increased HPV vaccination coverage in different settings. Contrary to our review, which included 35 studies, this similar comprehensive review, which searched five
databases for studies published between 2006 to 2015, resulted in 34 eligible studies. Like
their review, all the studies included in our review were conducted in high-income countries. Of the 35 studies included in our review, 32 were conducted in the USA and the
remaining three were from Australia, the Netherlands, and the UK. Acampora (2020) [13]
and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of interventions for improving HPV vaccination
coverage among adolescents. The authors found that reminder-based interventions, either
alone or in combination with other interventions, had a positive effect on vaccination
coverage [13]. In another review, the effectiveness of intervention for improving HPV
coverage among college students was assessed. The authors reported that the educational intervention that utilized a joint peer and medical provider message was the only
intervention in their review that significantly increased HPV vaccine uptake [14]. The
effectiveness of communication technology interventions on HPV vaccination coverage
was assessed by Francis (2017) [16] and found that usage of computer, mobile, or internet
technologies as the sole or primary mode for intervention delivery increased vaccination
coverage. Niccolai (2015) [6] conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of
practice- and community-based interventions on improving HPV vaccination coverage.
The review reported that several interventions including reminder and recall systems,
physician-focused strategies (e.g., audit and feedback), school-located programs, and social
marketing have improved vaccination coverage. The effectiveness of the interventions
that applied new media to improve vaccination coverage was assessed by Odone and
colleagues. The authors reported that text messaging, accessing immunization campaign
websites, using patient-held web-based portals and computerized reminders, and standing
orders increased vaccination coverage rates [57]. Walling and colleagues compared the
effectiveness of the informational-, behavioral-, and environmental-based interventions
on improving HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents and young adults aged 11 to
26 years. The authors found that environmental interventions, particularly school-based
vaccination programs were most effective in increasing vaccination coverage [15].


**5. Conclusions**


Although several interventions improved HPV vaccination coverage, the certainty
of the evidence varied from moderate to low. Although many studies were included in
our review, all of them were conducted in high-income countries. There is, therefore,
a need for further high-quality studies in low- and middle-income countries. At the
same time, many studies assessing the effect of different interventions on improving HPV
vaccination coverage were excluded because of the way they were conducted. As a result,
well-designed, well-implemented, and well-reported studies are needed. In addition, given
that there is limited information from existing studies on the cost of the tested interventions,
further studies are needed to address this challenge.
