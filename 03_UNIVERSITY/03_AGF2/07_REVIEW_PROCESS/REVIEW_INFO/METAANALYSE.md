**Abstract**

**Background:** Psychological therapies provided in primary care are usually briefer than in secondary care. There has
been no recent comprehensive review comparing their effectiveness for common mental health problems. We aimed
to compare the effectiveness of different types of brief psychological therapy administered within primary care across
and between anxiety, depressive and mixed disorders.


**Methods:** Meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials of brief psychological therapies of adult
patients with anxiety, depression or mixed common mental health problems treated in primary care compared to
primary care treatment as usual.


**Results:** Thirty-four studies, involving 3962 patients, were included. Most were of brief cognitive behaviour therapy
(CBT; _n_ = 13), counselling ( _n_ = 8) or problem solving therapy (PST; _n_ = 12). There was differential effectiveness between
studies of CBT, with studies of CBT for anxiety disorders having a pooled effect size [ _d_ -1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI)
-1.31 to -0.80] greater than that of studies of CBT for depression ( _d_ -0.33, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.06) or studies of CBT for
mixed anxiety and depression ( _d_ -0.26, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.08). Counselling for depression and mixed anxiety and
depression ( _d_ -0.32, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.11) and problem solving therapy (PST) for depression and mixed anxiety and
depression ( _d_ -0.21, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.05) were also effective. Controlling for diagnosis, meta-regression found no
difference between CBT, counselling and PST.


**Conclusions:** Brief CBT, counselling and PST are all effective treatments in primary care, but effect sizes are low
compared to longer length treatments. The exception is brief CBT for anxiety, which has comparable effect sizes.



**Background**
Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, with estimated combined prevalence varying between countries
but over 10% in most Western countries [1-4]. The
majority of such patients are treated in primary care, with
few patients referred on to secondary mental health services [5,6].
With access to psychological therapies being limited

[7], psychological therapy provided within primary care
settings for depression and anxiety is usually brief [8]. In
the UK, six sessions is a common treatment length [9].
This contrasts to the treatment lengths of 12 - 24 sessions

health disorders and types of psychological therapies
used within primary care date back over a decade [23-26].
This systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression includes studies of anxiety, depression and mixed
common mental health problems. It compares the effectiveness of different types of brief psychological therapies
within primary care across and between disorders compared to treatment as usual. In the absence of studies
directly comparing different types of psychological therapy provided in primary care (with one exception [27]),
such comparisons are needed to help inform decisions
about treatment.


**Methods**
**Search strategy**
Studies were identified as part of a broader search of
intervention studies in primary care mental health. The
Medline, Embase and Psycinfo databases from inception
to July 2008 were searched using a sensitive search strategy involving combinations of 'mental health' ('mental
health' or psychol* or anx* or depress* or schizo* or dysthymi* or psychiatr* or emotion* or counsel*) and 'primary care' terms ('primary care' or 'primary health care'
or 'family physician*' or 'practice nurs*' or 'general pract*'
or GP*) in order to maximize identification of relevant
interventions. Additional papers were identified from reference lists, from hand searching key journals and from
contact with other primary care mental health researchers. All searches were limited to peer-reviewed published
works in English.


**Inclusion criteria**
For this review, we included published randomized controlled trials of brief psychological therapies for adult
patients with anxiety, depression, unspecified common
mental health problems or 'emotional distress' provided
by someone other than the patient's general practitioner
(GP) either in primary care or at home organized from
primary care. 'Brief' was operationalized as more than
two and less than 10 appointments, this number being a
pragmatic choice on the grounds that it clusters around
the six sessions commonly offered in primary care in the
UK and is clearly fewer than the 12 - 24 sessions usually
provided in secondary care efficacy trials. Studies of computerized or facilitated self-help [28-30], of psycho-educational groups [31,32], and of psychological therapy
carried out as part of or referral on from case management within collaborative care [33], were excluded.


**Data extraction**
Data from included studies were extracted into structured summary tables. Studies were classified according
to type of psychological therapy and whether patients
included had major depressive disorder (MDD), minor



depression, mixed depression, anxiety or 'mixed anxiety
and depression' (where participants with a range of diagnoses of anxiety, depression, unspecified common mental
health problems or 'emotional distress' were included).
Outcome data closest to 4 months from baseline were
extracted where there was more than one follow-up
period, as this was the most common follow-up interval
used in our initial set of studies. Other information
extracted included: details of the participants; study
country; length of follow-up (weeks from baseline); number of treatment sessions; study design (individually randomized or cluster randomized); method of
randomization and allocation concealment; use of intention-to-treat analysis; primary symptom outcome measure(s); data of publication; number of participants
randomized and attrition from each group. The data were
initially extracted by one reviewer, with the results being
checked by a second reviewer who extracted the outcome
data independently, but otherwise was not blinded to the
findings of the first reviewer. Disagreements between
reviewers were resolved by discussion.
The quality of each study was assessed by one reviewer
who examined the adequacy of randomization and allocation concealment, and attrition using a modified version of the SIGN quality checklist for randomized
controlled trials [34]. A second reviewer, blinded to the
findings of the first reviewer, checked a sample of papers
for reliability of the quality assessment.


**Meta-analysis**
Comprehensive meta analysis (CMA) software, Version
2.2.040 [35] was used to calculate the standardized mean
difference ( _d_ ) and associated standard error for each
study, computed from means and standard deviations
(adjusted for baseline differences if reported) or from the
sample size and _P_ -value from an appropriate betweengroups _t_ - or _F_ -test if no other data were reported. We
used data from an intention-to-treat analysis, with last
observation carried forward, rather than data from participants who completed the study, if both were reported.
Where a study only reported data from dichotomous outcomes (remission or response to treatment), we assumed
that participants who ceased to engage in the study from whatever group - had an unfavourable outcome,
then converted the log odds ratio into _d_ using CMA. For
the purposes of the review, negative values of _d_ indicate
that the outcome favoured the intervention. The metan
command in Stata Version 9.2 [36] was used to produce
forest plots and summary effects using a random-effects
model.
We used _I_ [2 ] and the _Q_ test of heterogeneity [37,38] to
examine among-study variation in the meta-analysis. Significant variation was confirmed by visual inspection of
the forest plots. _I_ [2 ] describes the proportion of total varia

tion in study effect sizes that is due to heterogeneity as
opposed to sampling error, with 25%, 50% and 75% indicating low, moderate and high heterogeneity [38].
We conducted planned sub-group analyses based on
both type of psychological therapy and diagnosis. Sensitivity analyses were used to examine how robust these
findings were to assumptions made when calculating
effect size.
To check for publication bias, CMA was used to generate funnel plots and Egger's regression asymmetry test

[39]. Where asymmetry was detected, we assessed the
potential impact of the publication bias using the Duval
and Tweedie nonparametric 'trim and fill' method [40].
This method recalculates the effect size given the presence of publication bias.


**Meta-regression**
We used the metareg command in Stata, to conduct random-effects meta-regression analyses with restricted
maximum likelihood estimation and the improved variance estimator of Knapp and Hartung [41]. Where data
allowed, univariate models were used to examine whether
there were differences between psychological therapies
and between diagnostic categories in the magnitude of
the treatment effect. In addition, where possible, we used
multivariate models to control for the following study
characteristics if they were shown to be potential moderators in univariate models: country; year of publication;
number of sessions; total number of participants randomized; type of data (continuous versus dichotomous);
allocation concealment; use of intention-to-treat analysis;
and attrition. In our analyses, the regression coefficients
are the estimated change in _d_ per unit change in each
covariate.


**Results**
The flowchart outlining the search process is shown in
Figure 1. It should be noted that this represents the
entirety of the search, of which only a proportion related
to psychological therapies in primary care. Thirty-four
studies met our inclusion criteria. There were four studies excluded on basis of the psychological therapy being
10 sessions or more [42-45].
Details of the included studies are given in Table 1.
Twelve were of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) [4657], seven of counselling [58-64], one of interpersonal
psychotherapy [65], one of psychodynamic psychotherapy [66] and 12 of problem solving therapy (PST) [67-78].
One study included both a CBT and a counselling intervention arm compared to a usual GP treatment control

[27] and so in the meta-analysis the control group was
halved to avoid double counting.
Of the 34 studies, 14 were of patients with depression
(six MDD, four minor depression, four mixed depres


sion), seven were of anxiety disorders (three generalized
anxiety disorder, three panic disorder, one mixed phobic
disorders) and 13 studies were of patients with 'mixed
anxiety and depression' (including patients with a range
of diagnoses of anxiety, depression and unspecified common mental health problems).
Twenty-two of the 34 studies were carried out in UK
primary care, five in the USA, two in the Netherlands,
two in Australia, one in Sweden, one in Taiwan and one
was a multi-site study in five European countries. All
studies were randomized by the individual participant.
Seven studies were published in the 1980s, 13 in the
1990s and 14 in the present decade. In 14 studies the psychological therapy was conducted in the patients' usual
general practice or primary care clinic location, in two
studies over the telephone, in three studies at home, in
four studies both at home and in other primary care settings and in 11 studies the psychological therapy was
described as being carried out 'in a primary care setting',
'in a local health centre' or 'in primary care' without this
being further specified. The control condition for all
studies was usual GP care, supplemented in a few studies

[49-51,56,67,75,78] by the patient receiving some additional control intervention, for example placebo medication or a self-help booklet.
There was similar median treatment intensity of six to
seven contacts with the patient in CBT, counselling and
PST, with the single studies of interpersonal psychotherapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy each involving
eight sessions of treatment. In terms of the length of follow up, there was some variation between psychological
therapies (median 14 weeks for counselling, 13 weeks for
CBT, and 12 weeks for PST) and also between the CBT
for anxiety (12 weeks) and the CBT for depression studies
(16 weeks).
Table 1 also gives details of the quality assessment of
each study. The method of randomization was well covered (15% of studies) or adequately addressed (85%).
Allocation concealment was unclear (71%) in most studies. Sixteen (47%) studies were analysed by intention-totreat (ITT), with the remainder either not using ITT analysis or this being unclear in the reported paper. Twentyone (62%) studies reported less than 20% attrition across
both groups with eight studies (24%) reporting no attrition. In two studies [62,70] there was 50% or more attrition from either group.


**Effect size of psychological therapies**
The meta-analysis showed small effects favouring brief
CBT over usual GP care for both depression [ _d_ -0.33, 95%
confidence interval (CI) -0.60 to -0.06, _k_ = 4, _n_ = 450) and
mixed anxiety and depression ( _d_ -0.26, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.08, _k_ = 2, _n_ = 479) and a larger effect for brief CBT for
anxiety disorders (anxiety _d_ -1.06, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.80, _k_

= 7, _n_ = 450; Figure 2). In each meta-analysis, heterogeneity between studies was low (CBT for depression _I_ [2 ] = 0%,
_Q_ = 1.72, _P = 0_ .63; CBT for mixed anxiety and depression
_I_ [2 ] = 0%, _Q_ = 0.05, _P =_ .83; CBT for anxiety _I_ [2 ] = 15%, _Q_ =
7.07, _P = 0_ .32).
The meta-analysis suggested counselling was effective
for mixed anxiety and depression ( _d_ -0.30, 95% CI -0.53
to -0.07, _k_ = 4, _n_ = 487), while the effect size for counselling for depression, although similar in size, fell short of
statistical significance ( _d_ -0.41, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.03, _k_ = 4,
_n_ = 359; Figure 3). Heterogeneity between studies was
moderate to high for the studies of depression ( _I_ [2 ] = 63%,
_Q_ = 8.15, _P = 0_ .04) and low for mixed anxiety and depression ( _I_ [2 ] = 31%, _Q_ = 4.37, _P = 0_ .22). There were no studies
of counselling for anxiety disorders. Pooling across the
studies of depression and mixed anxiety and depression,
heterogeneity was intermediate ( _I_ [2 ] = 44%, _Q_ = 12.55, _P =_
_0_ .04), with a small effect favouring counselling over usual
GP care ( _d_ -0.32, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.11, _k_ = 8, _n_ = 846).
The effect size was smaller for PST for both depression
( _d_ -0.26, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.03, _k_ = 5, _n_ = 777) and mixed
anxiety and depression ( _d_ -0.17, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.07, _k_ =
6, _n_ = 579; Figure 4). Heterogeneity between studies
approached moderate for the studies of depression ( _I_ [2 ] =
45%, _Q_ = 9.11, _P = 0_ .11) and was moderate for mixed anx


iety and depression ( _I_ [2 ] = 50%, _Q_ = 10.01, _P = 0_ .08). There
were no studies of PST for anxiety disorders. Pooling
across all studies produced a small effect favouring PST
over usual GP care ( _d_ -0.21, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.05, _k_ = 12,
_n_ = 1356) with heterogeneity approaching a moderate
level ( _I_ [2 ] = 45%, _Q_ = 19.88, p = 0.05).
The evidence for interpersonal psychotherapy ( _d_ -0.11,
-0.47 to 0.24, _k_ = 1, _n_ = 120) and psychodynamic psychotherapy ( _d -_ 0.01, 95% CI = -0.64 to 0.63, _k_ = 1, _n_ = 38) was
inconclusive, although only one small study was included
for each of these in this review.
For the studies of depression and mixed anxiety and
depression, a series of random-effects meta-regressions
comparing types of psychological therapy, controlling for
diagnosis, indicated there was no difference between
CBT ( _k_ = 6) and counselling ( _k_ = 8; regression coefficient
-0.02, _P =_ .91, adjusted _R_ [2 ] = 0%, _n_ = 1584) or between CBT
( _k_ = 6) and PST ( _k_ = 12) (regression coefficient 0.10, _P =_
_0_ .45, adjusted _R_ [2 ] = 0%, _n_ = 2094) or between counselling
( _k_ = 8) and PST ( _k_ = 12) (regression coefficient 0.10, _P =_
_0_ .46, adjusted _R_ [2 ] = 0%, _n_ = 2202).


**Impact of diagnosis**
We conducted two sets of meta-regression analyses to
explore the effect of diagnosis on the magnitude of the

treatment effect. First, we looked at whether there was a
difference between studies of anxiety, depression and
mixed disorders in the 13 studies of CBT (Figure 2; Table
2). This analysis was limited to studies of CBT as all studies of anxiety disorders were of CBT. The results indicate
that there was a statistically significant difference favouring the studies of anxiety ( _k_ = 7) over depression ( _k_ = 4;
regression coefficient 0.72, _P_ = 0.005, adjusted _R_ [2 ] = 91%, _n_
= 709). There was also a significant difference favouring
the studies of anxiety ( _k_ = 7) over mixed anxiety and
depression ( _k_ = 2; regression coefficient 0.79, _P_ = 0.003,
adjusted _R_ [2 ] = 94%, _n_ = 929). There was no difference
between the studies of depression ( _k_ = 4) and mixed anxiety and depression ( _k_ = 2; regression coefficient 0.07, _P_ =
0.70, adjusted _R_ [2 ] = 0%, _n_ = 738). In accordance with our
planned analytic strategy, as no study characteristic other



than diagnosis predicted effect size of CBT studies in the
univariate models (Table 2), we did not use a multivariate
meta-regression model.
Translating the effect sizes for CBT for anxiety and
depression into Hamilton rating scale equivalents to give
an indicator of clinical significance [using all studies in
the database to estimate the Hamilton standard deviations], the effect size for CBT for depression was equivalent to a 2.3 point difference between groups on the
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [79] while the
effect size for CBT for anxiety was equivalent to 7.2
points on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety [80].
In the second set of meta-regressions, we examined
whether the type of depression diagnosis had an impact
on the treatment effect across types of psychological
therapy. The results indicate that there was no significant

difference between MDD ( _k_ = 6) and minor depression/
mixed depression ( _k_ = 9; regression coefficient 0.12, _P_ =
0.43, adjusted _R_ [2 ] = 2%, _n_ = 1515), or between minor
depression ( _k_ = 4) and MDD/mixed depression ( _k_ = 11;
regression coefficient -0.20, _P_ = 0.22, adjusted _R_ [2 ] = 25%, _n_
= 1515). No other study characteristic predicted effect
size of the depression studies, so no multivariate metaregression was used.


**Publication bias**
Funnel plots of the CBT studies, showed evidence of
asymmetry in the studies of CBT for anxiety (Egger's test,
one-tailed _P_ = 0.04), but not CBT for depression/mixed
anxiety and depression ( _P_ = 0.38). There was also evidence of asymmetry in the studies of counselling (onetailed _P_ = 0.03) and PST (one-tailed _P_ = 0.03). The Duval
and Tweedie 'trim and fill' method suggested that, for
CBT for anxiety, three studies were potentially missing
and, if imputed, the overall summary effect would drop to
_d_ -0.91 (95% CI -1.18 to -0.63). For counselling, imputing



three missing studies reduced the effect size to _d_ -0.19
(95% CI -0.41 to -0.04). For PST, imputing two missing
studies reduced the effect size to _d_ -0.14 (95% CI -0.32 to
-0.05).


**Discussion**
**Summary of main findings**
The majority of studies of brief psychological therapies
for anxiety and depression in primary care included in
this review were of CBT, counselling and PST, with a single study each of interpersonal psychotherapy and of psychodynamic psychotherapy. The meta-analysis suggests
that brief CBT, counselling and PST were all effective. No
significant difference was found between CBT, counselling and PST on meta-regression, when controlling for
diagnosis,
Brief CBT for anxiety (mostly generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder) had a greater impact on clinical
outcomes than brief CBT for depression or of mixed
groups of patients with common mental health problems,

for which the outcomes were similar to studies of counselling and of low clinical significance. There were no
studies of counselling or PST for anxiety disorders alone,
so it is not possible to establish from this review whether
this is a specific differential effect of CBT or whether
other brief psychological therapies might also have
greater effects on anxiety than depression.


**Comparison with existing literature**
Reviews of CBT have generally found larger effect sizes
compared to control for CBT as a treatment for anxiety
disorders, with smaller effects obtained for CBT as a
treatment for depression [12]. This is similar to the differential effect for brief CBT found in the present review. A
recent review of internet-based CBT of anxiety and
depression, also found differential effects between studies
of internet-based CBT on depression and studies of inter


net-based CBT on anxiety [81], with remarkably similar
effect sizes ( _d_ 0.27 depression, _d_ 0.93 anxiety) to those in
the present review ( _d_ 0.33 depression, _d_ 1.06 anxiety).
The summary effects obtained were generally lower
than reviews of secondary care based treatments, involving a longer duration of psychological therapies

[10,12,82]. These differences in effect size could be due to
a number of factors: length of treatment, type of included
patients, training of therapists or location of treatment. In
terms of type of included patients, participants in these
primary care based studies may have had less severe conditions than those in secondary care based studies which
would correspondingly limit the potential effect sizes.
Brief CBT for anxiety disorders was the exception, with
effect sizes in the present review comparable to those
obtained in reviews of longer secondary care based treatments [12,13]. This may not be unique to primary care. In

secondary care, a direct comparison of brief and standard
length CBT for panic disorder found equivalent effectiveness [83].


**Strengths and limitations of the study**
The strengths of the review are the inclusion of studies of
representative populations of primary care patients,
including with mixed anxiety and depression, and the use
of meta-regression to compare effectiveness between different types of problems and different types of psychological therapy.
Limitations are the restriction to published studies and
to English language publications. Other relevant studies
may have been missed, particularly negative studies leading to an overestimation of the effects of brief psychological therapies. We did find evidence of possible
publication bias and that accounting for this would have
reduced effect sizes, although not changed the key conclusions of the review. Type of outcome measures, number of treatment sessions, follow-up intervals, country,
number of participants randomized and aspects of study



quality varied between studies, increasing heterogeneity
and, hence, decreasing the likelihood of finding differences between types of psychological therapy and different diagnoses. Meta-regression ideally requires large
numbers of studies and the sample size of studies in the
review may have been too small to show other than relatively large effect size differences between types of psychological therapy.
The majority of studies in the meta-analysis used questionnaires and rating scales as outcome measures.
Although this is standard in measurement of depression
and anxiety outcomes, responses to such measures can
vary between gender, language, culture and setting and
are only a proxy for diagnosis. When analysed as continuous measures, there are potential problems caused by
lack of interval-scaling, which may result in a sigmoidal,
rather than linear, relationship between the score and the
underlying trait [84]. Dependence on such measures in
the meta-analysis is likely to have increased measurement
error and heterogeneity [85]. They may also have led to
systematic biases in the meta-regression where groups


Cape _et al._ _BMC Medicine_ 2010, **8** :38 Page 11 of 13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/8/38



being compared (for example, patients with MDD versus
minor and mixed depression) were using different measures or had baseline differences on the same measure.
A further limitation is the likely variation in locations
included as 'primary care'. Reviews of psychological therapies in primary care vary in definitions as to what is
included as primary care, with some reviews including
studies if patients are recruited in or referred from primary care irrespective of where patients are treated. We
set out to include studies where patients were treated
either in a primary care setting or at home organized
from primary care, but many study reports lacked details
of where patients were seen other than 'in a primary care
setting'. The significance of treatment in primary care is
considered to be familiarity and accessibility of location
and ease of liaison between GP and treating psychological
therapist but this will quite probably have varied widely,
given that studies varied from only one or two patients
treated per participating general practice [55,56,75], to a
few hundred [53]. Better reporting of location of treatment and nature of liaison with patients' GPs should be
encouraged in studies of treatment in primary care.


**Conclusions**
This review confirms the effectiveness of brief CBT,
counselling and PST for routine delivery in primary care
but with the caution that effect sizes are low when compared to patients receiving these treatments over a longer
duration, so for many patients brief treatments may not
be sufficient. The exception is brief CBT for anxiety disorders, which was comparable in effectiveness to longer
treatments. While this suggests that brief CBT is particularly effective with anxiety disorders and there is evidence
that training in CBT may enhance effectiveness of treatment of anxiety disorders by counsellors [86], the lack of
randomized studies of brief psychological therapies other
than CBT for patients suffering from anxiety disorders
means that it is not possible to definitively determine
whether brief CBT is more effective than other brief psychological treatments for anxiety disorders within primary care.
