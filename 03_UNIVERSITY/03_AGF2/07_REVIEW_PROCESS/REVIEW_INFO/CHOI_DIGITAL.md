**Abstract:** Digital technologies are being increasingly utilized in healthcare to provide pertinent
and timely information for primary prevention, such as vaccination. This study aimed to conduct
a systematic review to describe and assess current digital health interventions to promote HPV
vaccination among adolescents and parents of adolescents, and to recommend directions for future
interventions of this kind. Using appropriate medical subject headings and keywords, we searched
multiple databases to identify relevant studies published in English between 1 January 2017 and
31 July 2022. We screened and selected eligible studies for inclusion in the final analysis. We reviewed
a total of 24 studies, which included interventions using text messages (4), mobile apps (4), social
media and websites (8), digital games (4), and videos (4). The interventions generally improved
determinants of HPV vaccination, such as HPV-related knowledge, vaccine-related conversations,
and vaccination intentions. In particular, text message and social media interventions targeted
improved vaccine uptake behaviors, but little meaningful change was observed. In conclusion, digital
health interventions can cost-effectively provide education about HPV vaccination, offer interactive
environments to alleviate parental vaccine hesitancy, and ultimately help adolescents engage in HPV
vaccine uptake.

**1. Introduction**


The burgeoning field of digital health, which includes categories such as mobile health
(mHealth) and telemedicine, is at the forefront of healthcare transformations and public
health efficacy. The ubiquitous and evolving nature of digital tools, including mobile and
web-enabled devices, has led to a proliferation of technology-mediated interventions across
the healthcare continuum, from prevention to post-treatment surveillance [1]. To improve
health outcomes, these interventions facilitate access to real-time information, self-care
management that allows patient autonomy, and enhanced remote communication with
providers. Of particular significance is their impact on primary preventive services [2]
such as vaccination. While child and adolescent vaccinations can reduce, and in some
cases, eliminate many preventable diseases and provide additional health benefits (e.g.,
prevent costs associated with medical expenses), the success of any vaccination program
ultimately depends on its ability to address parents’ vaccine-related attributes, such as
forgetfulness and lack of knowledge, and parental decision-making about their children’s
vaccine uptake [3,4]. In this regard, digital health interventions have demonstrated the
potential to positively influence parental vaccination decisions and improve vaccine uptake
among children [5]. They can track vaccination schedules, send reminders [6], counter
misinformation to allay vaccine hesitancy [7], and provide dynamic online environments

coupled with social media platforms that allow to share information with other parents
and interact with vaccine experts [8].
Despite the growing number of digital health-based programs for child and adolescent vaccinations [9–13], there are comparatively fewer digital health interventions
advocating for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination [14,15]. For example, among over
200 vaccination-related mobile smartphone applications (apps) currently available, only a
small proportion pertains to HPV [16,17]. While HPV is responsible for approximately 4.5%
(640,000 cases) of new cancer cases diagnosed worldwide [18], adolescent HPV vaccine
uptake remains suboptimal compared to other vaccines [19]. This is primarily due to
parents’ low awareness, vaccine safety apprehension, and unfunded concerns about HPV
vaccination leading to an increase in sexual activity [20–23]. As eradication of vaccinepreventable diseases is a global public health priority [24], the promotion and uptake of the
prophylactic HPV vaccine should be maximized by technology-mediated interventions.
These interventions can efficiently educate parents with reliable information about HPV
vaccination and offer interactive environments in which parental vaccine hesitancy can
be alleviated [25]. Ilozumba et al. (2021) systematically reviewed digital interventions for
HPV vaccination promotion for both adolescents and caregivers of adolescents, but the
review was limited to only mHealth interventions delivered via mobile phones [16]. To
broaden the scope, the present systematic review aimed to describe and assess the use of
various digital tools for HPV vaccination promotion among adolescents and parents of adolescents and recommend directions for prospective digital health interventions to promote
HPV vaccination.


**2. Materials and Methods**


A systematic review of the literature was conducted and reported using the guidelines
of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
2020 checklist [26]. The detailed protocol of this review was registered a priori with
PROSPERO (CRD42022334244), an international database of prospectively registered
systematic reviews [27].


_2.1. Search Strategy and Information Sources_


Eligible articles about digital health interventions for HPV vaccination promotion
were reviewed extensively. The literature search was performed from the three major
bibliographic databases of Medline Ovid, Embase, and Cochrane. With the conjunction
“AND” and the disjunction “OR,” the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and
relevant keywords were used in the search process: child, adolescent, teenager, teen, youth,
parent, guardian, Human Papillomavirus, HPV vaccination, HPV vaccine, intervention,
digital, e-health, smartphone, mobile health, mHealth, mobile app, game, social media,
text message, and web-based. Reference lists of selected articles from multiple journals
were manually checked for other potentially relevant articles and all “related to” or similar
articles of the identified articles were followed. In addition, a hand search of the grey
literature (e.g., unindexed journals and relevant conference proceedings) was conducted.
Titles, abstracts, and keywords were further screened for inclusion upon obtaining results
that adhered to the search criteria.


_2.2. Eligibility Criteria_


Peer-reviewed articles written in English were included in this systematic review.
Given the speed at which technology develops, the review aimed to explore the most recent
research trends in digital health interventions for HPV vaccination promotion. Accordingly,
the inclusion time period included articles that were published within the last 5 years,
between 1 January 2017 and 31 July 2022. The review included articles specifically about the
design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions that deliver information, increase
awareness, and promote the uptake of HPV vaccination using digital technology that
encompasses electronic tools, mobile devices, and web-enabled devices. Furthermore,


_Vaccines_ **2023**, _11_, 249 3 of 15


the review included articles about digital health interventions that targeted exclusively
adolescents, parents of adolescents, and parent-adolescent dyads. Articles were excluded
from the review if they were observational studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or
content and sentiment analyses.


_2.3. Study Selection Process_


Study selection involved a four-step process. First, we systematically searched the
databases using the MeSH terms and keywords. When selecting the studies, we independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of all records identified as relevant to this systematic
review. Second, duplicate citations across the databases were identified using Endnote,
manually verified, and subsequently removed. Third, the remaining abstracts were checked
for eligibility. Fourth, the full-text articles of the included abstracts were screened according
to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This iterative selection and screening process was
followed by a final synthesis of the eligible studies, which were qualitatively analyzed.
This qualitative analysis entailed categorizing the interventions according to the technology
used to deliver the interventions, the theoretical basis of the interventions, as well as the
content, outcome measures, and results of the interventions. The same steps were taken
with articles identified in the grey literature.


_2.4. Quality Assessment for Risk of Bias_


Quality assessments were performed to assess the methodological quality of included
studies. We independently used the Cochrane Collaboration tool [28], which is used to
make judgments about the extent of bias in randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies.
RCT studies were evaluated for five potential biases: selection, performance, detection,
attrition, and reporting. The component ratings were scored as low risk, high risk, or
unclear. Furthermore, we followed the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool
for before-after (pre-post) studies with no control group (NIH) [29] to evaluate the quality
of nonrandomized quasi-experimental studies. This tool comprised a total of 12 items and
each item was rated as Yes, No or Not reported/Not able to determine/Not applicable.
The report of the risk of bias assessment is discussed in the results section, and a full
presentation is given in the Supplementary Materials (Tables S1 and S2).


**3. Results**
_3.1. Search Results_


The literature search and review process are shown in Figure 1. We first searched
Medline Ovid, PubMed, and Embase, retrieving a total of 1284 records. There were
692 records after duplicates were removed within and across databases. We further screened
the title or abstract to identify whether the key terms were present, and whether the content
fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We identified 65 records for full-text review and excluded
41 articles because they were not an intervention ( _n_ = 16), were not targeted to parents
or adolescents ( _n_ = 11), were based on analyses of content or sentiment ( _n_ = 4), were not
technology-based ( _n_ = 8), or had abstracts only ( _n_ = 2). We identified a total of 24 studies
published between 1 January 2017 and 31 July 2022 as the final set of records for the review.
No additional eligible articles were identified.

_3.2. Study Characteristics_


Among the 24 articles selected for analysis, four studies focused on text messaging [30–33],
four studies pertained to mobile apps [34–37], eight studies were social media and websitebased interventions [38–45], four studies were game-based interventions [46–49], and
four studies were video-based interventions [50–53]. Thirteen studies (54%) targeted
parents, seven studies (29%) targeted both parents and adolescents, and four studies
(17%) targeted only adolescents. Fifteen of the studies [30–33,36,37,41,43–46,51–53] were
RCTs and four studies [38,42,49,50] were non-randomized pre-post designs without a
control group. Selected studies did not represent various geographical settings as most
of the studies (18/24, 75%) were conducted in the United States. All but five studies
were theory-informed; being the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior
the most frequently employed theories. The main outcome measures examined in these
studies were categorized as knowledge about HPV and HPV vaccination, vaccination
intention, vaccine uptake, and qualitative feedback for those that tested a prototype of
their interventions. Knowledge about HPV and HPV vaccination was measured in ten
studies [31,36–40,46,47,49,51], vaccination intention in nine studies [36–38,42,44,50,51,53],
vaccine uptake in 13 studies [30–33,39–46,52], and eight studies focused on qualitative user
feedback of the interventions [34,35,39,42,46–49]. Common features across the interventions
were dissemination of HPV and HPV vaccine information, tailored feedback or personal
stories about vaccinating children against HPV, vaccine reminders, HPV discussion forums
or Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), scheduling assistance or clinic locator, and guidance
on how to initiate conversations with children about HPV (Figure 2). Table 1 is an overview
of the interventions organized by type of technology. A summary of the interventions is
included in the Supplementary Materials (Table S3). We discuss the included interventions
in detail below.

_3.3. SMS Text Message Interventions_


Four studies in this review were SMS text message interventions [30–33]. Text message
reminders to parents of vaccine-eligible adolescents are generally reported as an effective
means for their timely uptake of the HPV vaccine, especially regarding vaccine series
completion [30–33]. In a study that assessed the effect of phone or text message reminders
to parents, adolescents of parents who received text message reminders completed the
series 71 days earlier compared to the control, with 18% more adolescents achieving full
vaccination [30]. Although the time to receipt of subsequent doses for adolescents of
participants in the phone reminder group was not different compared to the control, text
message reminders were significantly effective for those who had already initiated the
vaccine series. Another intervention found a contrasting result, where the benefits of
text message reminders were restricted to individuals who had missed an earlier dose
while those who were up to date with the vaccine almost always completed the three-dose
schedule without the intervention [32]. A study conducted among an uninsured population
also reported that adolescents of parents who received text message reminders returned for
the second dose of the HPV vaccine at a higher rate than the control group. However, this
finding was not statistically significant [31].
Text messages with tailored content in theory-informed interventions did not yield
drastic success as anticipated. While timely text message reminders helped shift parents
from the pre-contemplation and contemplation stages to preparation and fully vaccinated
stages, educational information in the messages tailored to their stage of decision-making


_Vaccines_ **2023**, _11_, 249 7 of 15


had minimal impact on their adolescents’ vaccine series completion [33]. In addition, no
significant difference was observed in vaccination rates between motivational text messages
emphasizing one’s susceptibility to HPV and self-regulatory text messages highlighting implementation intentions [32]. However, both types of messages elicited higher vaccination
rates compared to the control condition. Three of the four studies reported that no gender
differences were observed regarding the vaccine uptake of adolescents [30–32].


_3.4. Mobile App Interventions_


Four studies pertained to mobile apps developed to provide parents with information
regarding adolescent HPV vaccination and promote uptake and completion of the HPV vaccine series [34–37]. Two of the studies focused on the formative assessment of a prototype
HPV vaccine app, Vaccipack and Vax4HPV [34,35]. Distinct features of Vaccipack included
a vaccine checklist, inspirational stories about parents drawing on common parental beliefs,
and an active discussion forum about HPV vaccination. When the perceived usefulness of
Vaccipack was measured, 82% of parents and 85% of adolescents found the app beneficial
whereas a higher percentage of parents (88%) than adolescents (75%) showed intention to
use the app. This finding was associated with higher levels of app acceptability among
parents [34]. Users of Vax4HPV received personalized HPV recommendations tailored to
their willingness to vaccinate their children, and assistance to search the nearest clinics.
Users of this app were also provided an exemplar script to help them facilitate parent-child
communication about the vaccine. In addition to acknowledging that the app closed the
intention-behavior gap by offering scheduling appointments and locating clinics, parents
suggested that the app provide gender-neutral information to eliminate vaccine hesitancy [35]. Education about adolescent vaccination and parent-adolescent communication
about the HPV vaccine were the most cited anticipated benefits for both apps.
Two studies evaluated HPV vaccination intention and vaccine initiation behavior
following the use of the apps [36,37]. HPV CancerFree (HPVCF) comprised various educational contents including debunking misinformation, functioned as a medium to facilitate
parent-provider communication, and operated as an assistant to schedule HPV vaccination
appointments. Although parents who used the app became significantly more knowledgeable about HPV and the HPV vaccine and perceived the app to be effective compared
to those who did not use the app, HPV vaccination intention rates did not significantly
differ between the two groups [36]. Consequently, vaccine initiation was not found to be
significantly greater for parents who used the app compared to those who did not. Modules
of Vacteens.org were similar to features in other apps, as they addressed misinformation
about the HPV vaccine, provided a discussion forum between parents and providers, presented examples of parent-adolescent communication about the vaccine, provided clinic
locators, and scheduling assistance for HPV vaccination. In this study, the rates of HPV
vaccination initiation and series completion were 18.8% and 36.8% higher, respectively,
among parents who used the app compared to those in the usual and customary information condition [37]. The app also bolstered parents’ positive HPV vaccine beliefs, which
was a likely contributing factor for higher levels of vaccine initiation and series completion.


_3.5. Social Media and Web-Based/Online Interventions_


Eight interventions in this review were delivered via social media platforms and
websites alike. In two interventions, which were a Facebook campaign to cultivate mother
champions of HPV vaccination and a website providing mothers with tailored feedback
from virtual assistants, both groups of mothers had significantly increased knowledge about
HPV and HPV vaccine [38,39]. In the former study, mothers reported that the Facebook
campaign addressed important gaps in knowledge about men’s susceptibility to HPV,
as well as head and neck cancers and their link with HPV [38]. The majority of parents
(86.4%) in this study noted that they gained confidence in starting conversations after
their training as champions, which was consistent with the findings of another Facebook
campaign, 3forME, that generated awareness and conversations among adolescents [39].


_Vaccines_ **2023**, _11_, 249 8 of 15


Likewise, adolescents who were notified every time a new message about HPV and vaccinerelated facts was posted to a Facebook page, About Your Health, were more likely to have
interpersonal discussions with others about what they learned and improved in knowledge
at 3-months post-intervention [40]. However, the analyses did not reveal any significant
differences by gender of adolescents for any of the outcomes.
Regarding vaccination behavior, a Facebook campaign, Health Chat, delivered to
mothers was effective, as mothers reported significantly higher initiation of their adolescents’ HPV vaccination at 12- (71.3%) and 18-months (73.3%) posttest, compared to baseline
(63.4%). Completion of HPV vaccination was conveyed by 62.5% and 65.9% of mothers at
12 and 18 months, respectively, both of which represented a significant increase compared
to the baseline rate of 50.2% [41]. Another web-based intervention for parents accessed via a
tablet resulted in a significant positive change as all participants intended to vaccinate their
children and self-reported a high vaccination rate (95.8%) post-intervention [42]. Several
other interventions exerted negligible effects on vaccination behavior. In the 3forME campaign, only two adolescents were vaccinated as a result of the intervention [39]. A different
Facebook campaign had little or no impact among mothers in the upper socioeconomic
status quartile and a negative effect among women in the lowest socioeconomic status
quartile in terms of initiating vaccine uptake for their adolescents [43]. In the websitebased intervention with the virtual assistants, no effects were found on HPV vaccination
uptake although mothers experienced positive changes in the determinants of vaccination,
such as knowledge, intention and perceived effectiveness of the vaccine [44]. Delivered
on an iPad, the CHICOS website based on the concept of tailored messaging conveyed
informational materials crafted to reflect parents’ HPV-related questions, experiences, and
perceptions; there were no statistically significant differences in the improvement of vaccination intention or children’s vaccine completion between the intervention group and the
control group [45].


_3.6. Game-Based Interventions_


Four studies illuminated the feasibility of digital games to increase knowledge about
HPV and HPV vaccination and vaccine uptake among parents and adolescents [46–49]. For
maximal engagement and motivation, these games had features to attract youth primarily
by incorporating animated game characters with entertaining storylines. For example, the
Land of Secret Gardens created a story about a secret garden as a metaphor for a preteen’s
body and keeping it healthy [46]. FightHPV portrayed interactions between various characters such as epithelial cells, warts, precancerous cells, low-risk HPV, high-risk HPV, and
HPV vaccine [47]. A common function of the included games was the communication of
tailored feedback addressing knowledge about HPV, HPV-related diseases, and benefits of
HPV vaccination via messages and episodes presented to players. A greater proportion of
adolescents who played the Land of Secret Gardens game initiated the vaccine and had
higher completion rates than their counterparts in the control group. However, these differences were not statistically significant [46]. Adolescents in the multimedia intervention
noted higher intentions to discuss HPV vaccination with their parents after playing the
game [49]. Adolescents who played the We Care-Teen game commented that they would
like more interactions in the game to facilitate HPV-related discussions with parents and
suggested to include HPV-related illness for both males and females [48].


_3.7. Video-Based Interventions_


Four video-based interventions for parents to improve HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge and intention to vaccinate their adolescents reported positive results [50–53]. In a
digital story-telling intervention, participants watched two 3-min long personal digital
stories about HPV vaccination from mothers of already vaccinated children. In this study,
74% of the participants intended to vaccinate their children, which significantly differed
from 53% preintervention, and mothers expressed slightly more positive attitudes towards
the need to vaccinate girls than boys after the intervention [50]. Is the HPV vaccine for me?


_Vaccines_ **2023**, _11_, 249 9 of 15


Was a 6-min video mapping the adolescent HPV vaccine decision journey in Ireland with
evidence-based information and reminders that most girls in the country have received the
HPV vaccine [51]. Participants in the intervention group scored significantly higher on the
knowledge assessment compared to the control group and 88% of participants indicated
that the video increased the HPV vaccine acceptance for their adolescents, compared to
49% at the outset being undecided [51]. In another intervention, when parents were shown
a video about the risks and benefits of the HPV vaccine or received reinforcement messages
on a mobile tablet in a clinic examination room, their vaccine-eligible adolescents had
up to 3-times greater odds of receiving a dose of the HPV vaccine [51,52]. Mothers in
another video-based intervention received tailored messages addressing one versus five
most common parental concerns about HPV vaccination. The adjusted mean scores for
vaccination intent post-intervention were 3.5/10, 3.9/10, and 4.2/10 among the control,
top-concern, and all-concerns groups, respectively. Compared to the control group, more
mothers in the all-concerns group and the top-concern group reported “very high intent”
to vaccinate (scores _≥_ 8) by 7.9% and 1.9%, respectively [53].
RCT studies included in this review were at relatively low risk for selection and
reporting biases, whereas detection bias was the most frequently occurring bias. Many
of the studies did not provide clear and thorough information regarding their risk for
performance and reporting biases. Regarding the single-group nonrandomized studies
included in this review, they fulfilled most of the items listed on the assessment tool.
However, none of the studies had a sufficiently large sample size to provide confidence in
their findings. Moreover, none of the studies reported the blinding of outcome assessment
or included outcome measures that were collected multiple times before and after the
intervention. A full report of the quality assessment for each study is included in the
Supplementary Materials.


**4. Discussion**
_4.1. Principal Findings_


Over the last five years, HPV promotion interventions have been developed and
delivered using various technologies: text messages, mobile apps, social media, digital
games, and videos. Text messaging, as an early basic feature of mHealth [54], continues
to be effective in reminding parents to initiate their adolescents’ HPV vaccination and to
return for subsequent doses [55]. Mobile apps, which have advanced mHealth following
the advent of tablets and smartphones, allow for the relay of educational components
along with immediate feedback to increase parents’ HPV vaccination knowledge and intentions [56,57]. On social media platforms, important messages about HPV vaccination can
be shared and parents are empowered to engage in vaccine-related public discourse [58].
Interactive social media interventions (e.g., online discussion forums, chat rooms, and “ask
an expert” features [8]) can help build trust, combat vaccine bias, and ameliorate parents’
vaccine hesitancy [5,59]. However, a major caveat is that because the internet is a powerful
conduit of vast amounts of vaccine arguments, anti-vaccination beliefs, and misinformation
on social media may wield greater influence on vaccine-hesitant parents [60–62]. Recently,
the use of digital games in a non-game context has gained popularity in public health to
tackle vaccine acceptance [63,64]. Gamification features, such as audiovisual interfaces,
interactive quizzes, reward systems, and unique characters, can be used to debunk myths
about the vaccine in entertaining ways [65], and drive emotional engagement in players [66]. Game-based interventions may appeal to adolescents [67,68] and parents who are
adept with technology and accept games to advocate controversial health issues such as
HPV vaccination [69].
Our findings indicate that user perceptions and effects of the interventions were generally positive albeit with a few unexpected results. Contrary to the lack of theory-informed
mHealth interventions reported by a previous review [16], almost all the interventions in
this review were theory-based, which portrays an increasing trend of digital interventions
using a theoretical framework. This finding is promising as researchers have emphasized


_Vaccines_ **2023**, _11_, 249 10 of 15


applying theory to the design and evaluation of health promotion interventions to achieve
desired health outcomes [70]. However, eight interventions in this review detected minimal
merit of theory-based approaches [32,33,36,38,39,43,44,46]. For example, no differential
effect was found between the messages incorporating a self-regulatory strategy and the
messages using a motivational strategy. It was speculated that receiving a “plain” message
without any theory basis may have been equally effective at increasing HPV vaccine uptake [32]. Furthermore, educational text messages to target the stage of parental vaccine
decision-making referring to the Transtheoretical Model did not have added benefits [33].
In other interventions that employed theories, including the health belief model, social
cognitive theory, theory of reasoned action, and inoculation theory [36,38,39,43,44,46], the
interventions produced positive changes but not of statistical significance or they had only
modest effects. Although not in line with earlier research that argued for theory-based
interventions to increase effectiveness [71], our findings confirm the need to consistently
re-evaluate theory-based digital health interventions to promote HPV vaccination.
While digital technologies are not supplanting traditional in-person medical consultations [72,73], several interventions in this review underscored their role as facilitators of effective provider-parent communication and education about HPV vaccination [35,37,46,48,52]. The interventions helped parents and adolescents become confident in
discussing vaccination with their providers [37,40,48,52]. Moreover, parents could browse
the apps to learn about HPV vaccination and make informed decisions, which lessened the
reliance on providers. Education offered by the apps prior to clinic visits helped providers
talk more comfortably with parents about HPV vaccination, knowing that many of their
concerns were already covered [34,35,37]. For maximal effectiveness and safe use of digital
interventions, providers’ insights about the credibility of these tools are crucial before
dissemination to users. In fact, adolescents in Teitelman’s study were more willing to use
an app and trust its content when it was advised by a healthcare provider [34], which
elucidates that their acceptance of the app is conditional on the advice from their most
trusted source of health information.
Another interesting point raised by this review is that although the interventions,
particularly those delivered via apps, social media, and digital games, were well-received
and strengthened key determinants of HPV vaccination, little meaningful change was
observed in the actual vaccine uptake or vaccination rates [31,32,36,42–46]. The increase
in HPV and vaccination knowledge, vaccine-related conversations, as well as positive
vaccination beliefs and intentions are likely indications of the decision to vaccinate, but
they may not be sufficient to cause behavior change, resulting in an intention-behavior
gap [35,74]. Uncertainty may exist as to what psychosocial change is expected to turn
parental decisional balance toward a decision to vaccinate [36]. Future digital interventions
for HPV vaccination should reflect key differences between factors that influence intention
versus actual vaccination behavior [75]. We anticipate that carefully crafted but succinct,
resonating text messages can help parents and adolescents execute concrete action plans
that can optimally meet the behavioral goal of HPV vaccination [76]. Novel approaches,
such as digital games and social media platforms, have demonstrated great potential for
promotion and educational purposes despite their nascent stages of development [77], but
a more familiar and longstanding mHealth tool of text messaging is not to be underrated.
Except for five studies that targeted parents of daughters [37,41,43,44,51], the included
studies targeted adolescents of both genders, given that vaccination rates for boys remain
well below the Healthy People 2020 goals [52]. While no gender differences were observed
regarding adolescents’ vaccine uptake and vaccine knowledge post-intervention [30–32,40],
parents in one study were more likely to vaccinate girls than boys after the intervention [50].
Nonetheless, several studies in this review articulated the importance of gender-neutral
HPV vaccination and providing information related to male susceptibility to HPV in the
digital interventions to nudge boys to adopt the vaccination behavior [35,38,47,48]. Digital
tools and social media platforms are increasingly exploited in the public health arena to
increase awareness and acceptance of vaccination [78]. As part of this transformation,


_Vaccines_ **2023**, _11_, 249 11 of 15


developers of digital interventions for HPV vaccination should consider tailoring design
elements and content of the interventions to the gender of users to align with the recommended universal HPV vaccination [42,48].
Finally, this review affirmed the recurrently mentioned challenge of population appropriateness for digital health interventions. Despite their cost-effectiveness and convenience,
digital interventions for vaccine adherence may not produce positive outcomes if they
are implemented for populations of low socioeconomic status [79]. For example, we observed that an electronic reminder system with educational messaging about HPV and
HPV vaccine did not significantly improve knowledge and vaccination rates among an
underserved population [31], and a social media campaign was not effective among women
of low socioeconomic status in initiating vaccine uptake for their adolescents [43]. These
findings reveal a digital divide and the need to consider sub-population circumstances
when implementing digital interventions for the controversial issue of HPV vaccination [16].
Trials of a prototype intervention and a subsequent evaluation are important for prospective parent users, given that users of technology tend to be younger [80]. For example,
parent participants in five of the included interventions provided constructive feedback
describing potential advantages and areas for improvement after their experience with
the interventions [34,35,42,46,48]. As these parents had adolescents between the ages of
9 and 17 years, incorporating their opinions and proposed changes can gradually reduce
the digital divide for older parents who may not readily accept such interventions.


_4.2. Strengths and Limitations_


There are several limitations in this systematic review. A limited number of databases
were searched, which may have led to selection and reporting biases, and included studies
were limited to distinct geographical settings, mainly in the US and European countries,
although unintended. Social media interventions were limited to Facebook campaigns. The
evidence in this review may also not be robust enough to represent all the current digital
interventions for HPV vaccination because we focused only on parents and adolescents
as the intervention recipients, without targeting providers. The strengths of this study
are its focus on an overarching collection of digital tools and technology-mediated HPV
promotion interventions, beyond mHealth. We were able to verify the advantages of using
digital interventions but also their overlooked weaknesses. This review can also serve as a
useful guide for countries with high digital technology penetration but low awareness of
HPV vaccination to develop successful digital interventions for HPV vaccination, which
can pave the path to adopt gender-neutral vaccination in the near future.


**5. Conclusions**


In this systematic review, we examined 24 digital health interventions incorporating
text messages, mobile apps, social media and websites, games, and videos to promote
adolescent HPV vaccination. Digital health interventions hold tremendous potential as
a cost-effective and timely strategy to promote HPV vaccination; however, closing the
intention-behavior gap remains a difficult task. While mobile apps and digital games
facilitated education and active discussions around HPV thereby positively influencing
knowledge and vaccination intentions, text message and social media interventions aimed
to improve vaccine uptake behaviors, although the change was not always significant.
Nonetheless, the interventions were found to support informed decision-making of adolescents and parents about HPV vaccination, expediting their communication with healthcare
providers. Finally, continual revision of the interventions based on user feedback and
considerations of parent characteristics is key to improving HPV vaccination outcomes
among adolescents.
