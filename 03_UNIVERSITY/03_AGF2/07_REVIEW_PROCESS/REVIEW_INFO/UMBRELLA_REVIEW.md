### _Abstract_


**Background:** Digital nursing technologies (DNTs) are a promising solution to address challenges in health care systems, such
as demographic shifts, nursing shortages, or difficulties in retaining nurses. Despite their potential benefits, the integration of
DNTs into care settings remains complex due to multiple factors influencing their implementation and adoption.

**Objective:** We aimed to examine factors that influence the implementation and adoption of DNTs used in nursing care settings
from the perspective of nurses.

**Methods:** We used an umbrella review methodology to synthesize the evidence on DNTs and the complexities of their
implementation. We searched for systematic reviews that focused on DNTs in formal care settings across 4 databases (PubMed,
CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Business Source Premier) and examined reference lists of the included reviews published in
English until January 2025. Two researchers independently performed data extraction and quality assessment. Data analysis was
structured by embedding the results in the NASSS (nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability) framework,
a model for explaining the adoption and abandonment of health and care technologies, as well as challenges to their scaling,
diffusion, and sustainability. Reporting of this study adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses) checklist.

**Results:** A total of 4803 reviews were identified, of which 65 (1.36%) met the inclusion criteria. We identified 52 influencing
factors across 6 NASSS domains, with particular emphasis on adopter-related barriers and facilitators. Key barriers included
insufficient training, increased workload, and low technological confidence, which impacted efficiency and the quality of care.
In addition, concerns regarding professional role, autonomy, and privacy influenced nurses’ acceptance of DNTs. Facilitators
included leadership support, a positive corporate culture, and targeted training initiatives.

**Conclusions:** We synthesized key facilitators and barriers to implementation and adoption of DNTs in nursing care. Leadership
support, adequate training, and alignment with care needs drive successful implementation, while resource constraints and
workflow disruptions pose challenges. Addressing both technological requirements and nursing needs is critical. Future research
should focus on long-term studies and practical tools to support stakeholders in effectively integrating DNTs into nursing practice.

### _Introduction_

**Background**


In the context of pressing challenges, such as workforce
shortages and aging populations [1], digital technologies have
emerged as a potential means to improve the working conditions
of health care professionals while enhancing the quality of care

[2,3]. As a result, research on digital health technologies has
expanded significantly across a range of disciplines, including
engineering, medicine, nursing, psychology, philosophy, and
sociology [4]. However, the interdisciplinary nature and broad
scope of this research landscape make it increasingly complex
and difficult to navigate [5].


Despite the growing interest in this area, most studies and
reviews of digital health technologies tend to focus primarily
on physician or patient outcomes, although nurses constitute
approximately 44.7% of the global health workforce, accounting
for around 27.9 million nurses worldwide [1]. Given their central
role in patient care, nurses are key users of digital nursing
technologies (DNTs) and play a crucial role in their adoption
and effective implementation in nursing care settings [6]. DNTs
are tools designed to help nurses provide high-quality care by
facilitating rapid decision-making (eg, decision support systems
for adherence to clinical guidelines) or complementing nursing
tasks with technological solutions (eg, robots that assess vital
signs before consultations or sensors that detect bed-exit events
to prevent falls) [7]. These technologies serve multiple purposes,
including enhancing patient safety, improving workflow
efficiency, and reducing the physical and cognitive burden on
nurses [8]. DNTs can function as stand-alone tools for individual
nurses or be embedded in broader organizational care processes,
such as integrated electronic health record systems or automated
medication dispensing systems. By addressing specific clinical
or operational needs, DNTs aim to optimize resource use and
support nurses in managing complex care environments [7,8].
A detailed document outlining the DNT categories and
definitions is provided in Multimedia Appendix 1 [7].


In recent years, there has been an increasing number of research
and innovation initiatives at national and international levels,
driven by high expectations of improving care through the
implementation of DNTs [8-10]. However, the rate of successful
implementation and sustainable uptake remains rather low,
regardless of these efforts [7,11]. This may be due to a range
of factors, such as organizational resistance [9], limited
infrastructure [10], or insufficient training [11], which hinder
the seamless integration of DNTs into care workflows and limit
their potential to transform nursing practice. The complex and
dynamic nature of the nursing care setting makes it challenging
to determine clear cause-and-effect relationships in technology
implementation [12]. DNTs can have both positive and negative
impacts, which may not always be immediately apparent or
easily measured. For example, a study of the implementation
of a new patient monitoring system [13] found that the system’s
real-time alerts reduced response times to critical situations but
also may have led to alarm fatigue among nurses, ultimately
reducing their effectiveness in responding to urgent alerts. In
addition, changes in health care policy or budget constraints



can affect the availability of necessary infrastructure or training
programs, further complicating the process of understanding
the factors that lead to the successful implementation and
adoption, or the failure, of DNTs [14].


Although several evaluation frameworks for digital technologies
exist [14-18], as well as scoping and systematic reviews that
examine different types (eg, monitoring, sensors, and robots);
settings (eg, formal and informal care); and outcomes (eg,
acceptability, effectiveness, and efficiency) [7,8,19], significant
gaps remain in understanding the factors that influence the
implementation and adoption of DNTs.


**Objectives**


We aimed to explore the factors (barriers and facilitators) that
influence the implementation and adoption of DNTs used in
nursing care settings from the perspective of nurses.


Our paper contributes by synthesizing existing evidence through
an umbrella review approach, providing a comprehensive
overview of the key factors influencing DNT implementation
and adoption. To our knowledge, no existing review aims to
synthesize and map all relevant influencing factors across the
spectrum of implementation and adoption for DNTs in the
context of formal care.


By identifying these key factors, stakeholders can better address
barriers, tailor interventions, and create environments that foster
the effective integration of DNTs.

### _Methods_


**Design**


The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist was used to conduct and
report our findings [20].


Due to the large number of relevant reviews, we decided to
conduct an umbrella review to compile, synthesize, and
summarize the results of several systematic reviews [21]. This
design allows us to provide a comprehensive overview of the
current landscape of DNTs to support nursing care across
settings and interventions [21]. In addition, we aimed to identify
potential gaps in the existing evidence to guide the direction of
future research initiatives. The umbrella review framework is
conceptualized as a systematic review in which only reviews
are used as the fundamental unit of analysis within the
overarching structure [22]. This methodological approach is
particularly well suited to broad areas of inquiry, where the aim
is to provide a consolidated summary of the most rigorously
conducted reviews of advances within a particular field [22].
Using this approach, it is possible to identify gaps in the existing
literature and to synthesize and present the most important
findings [22]. The review protocol was registered in the Open
Science Framework [23]. Minor amendments were made to the
study protocol during the peer-review process. These included
a revision of the study title and an extension of the literature
search period.

**Search Strategy**


A sensitive search was conducted using the PICO (population,
intervention, comparison, outcome) scheme to guide the
systematic review process [24].


We performed a systematic literature search in 4 databases
(PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Business Source
Premier) between March 2023 and May 2023. Although no
specific number of databases is required for an umbrella review,
the selection should be based on the research question and the
scope of the review [25]. The four databases used in this review
were chosen to ensure coverage of literature relevant to our
topic due to their strong thematic relevance. During the
preliminary phase, we conducted a pilot search to refine the
search strategy (SW and CA). Keywords (including MeSH

[Medical Subject Headings] terms and synonyms) were grouped
into three overarching categories: (1) DNT, (2) implementation,
and (3) formal care. These categories were linked using the
logical operator “AND,” while terms within each category were
linked using “OR.” The search terms were tailored to the specific
criteria of each database.


The results of the pilot search were reviewed for
appropriateness, and the search strategy for the main search was
iteratively refined. To ensure methodological rigor, the final

**Inclusion criteria**



search strategy was validated in collaboration with a library
consultant from the Furtwangen University. The search was
updated in December 2024 and January 2025 to include the
most recent publications. We also screened the reference lists
of the included reviews to reduce the risk of missing relevant
articles. The complete search strategy, along with
database-specific adjustments, are provided in Multimedia
Appendix 2.


**Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria**


The inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined based on the
PICO framework [24], focusing on the population (nurses), the
intervention (DNTs), and the outcome (factors influencing the
implementation and adoption of DNTs). The comparison
component was not applicable to this study and was therefore
excluded. Refer to Textbox 1 for details. Studies had to meet
the following inclusion criteria: reviews where nurses were
either the primary focus or where findings on nurses’
perspectives could be meaningfully extracted were included;
reviews including mixed professional groups (eg, physicians,
therapists, and nurses) were only included if they reported
clearly distinguishable results relevant to nurses; only knowledge
synthesis publications, such as frameworks and reviews, were
considered; and studies written in English or German and
published between 2006 and 2024 were included.




 - Population: nurses and other health care professionals, including nurses

 - Intervention: digital nursing technologies (DNTs), categorized according to Multimedia Appendix 1. Additionally, technologies not only used
by nurses (eg, electronic medical records [EMRs]), but also clearly relevant to nursing practice, are included.


 - Outcome: factors influencing the introduction, implementation, or adoption, and target criteria related to the influencing factors (eg, attitude and
feasibility)


 - Study type: synthesis of studies (systematic reviews) based on qualitative or quantitative primary studies, peer-reviewed articles, and open-access
articles.


 - Language: English and German


**Exclusion criteria**


 - Population: only other health professionals (eg, physicians), relatives only, and patients only

 - Intervention: only other technologies, only other objectives or end points, and purely technical evaluations of technologies

 - Outcome: studies that do not address influencing factors

 - Study type: empirical studies (qualitative and quantitative primary studies, mixed methods designs, and reviews of empirical studies) and studies
that do not focus on the results of other studies


 - Language: other languages



The exclusion criteria were applied to studies that did not
contain results regarding factors influencing the implementation
and adoption of DNTs in the context of nursing care. Primary
studies, randomized controlled trials, books, dissertations, and
gray literature were also excluded, as these types of publications
do not meet the level of knowledge synthesis required for this
type of review [21]. In addition, a temporal exclusion criterion
was enforced to exclude studies published before 2006. This
was done because such articles may not provide relevant
evidence, as the technologies are likely to be outdated by that
time [26].



**Data Extraction and Quality Assessment**


During the initial screening phase, which included title and
abstract screening, each article was individually assessed by at
least 2 reviewers (SW and CA). Disagreements were resolved
through constructive dialogue and when necessary, by a third
reviewer (CK). The subsequent full-text review followed the
same protocol. The articles that met all the inclusion criteria
were thoroughly reviewed using a structured data extraction
form.

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Walzer et al



The data extraction form was used to extract relevant details
covering study attributes (eg, title, year, authorship, country,
review type, and the number of studies included) and details of
integrated technologies and any content relevant to
implementation aspects, including identifiable barriers and
facilitators. Data extraction was performed independently by 2
reviewers (SW and SM). The resulting data extraction was
reviewed and refined for each article.


To assess the quality of the included studies, we used the Joanna
Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic
Reviews and Research Syntheses [27]. This checklist is a widely
accepted and validated tool designed to ensure the
methodological rigor and transparency of systematic reviews.
It includes 10 criteria that address key aspects of the review
process, including the clarity of the review question, the
appropriateness of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the
transparency of the study selection process, and the
comprehensiveness of the search strategy. Other important
dimensions assessed include the standardization of the data
extraction process, the thoroughness of the quality assessment
of the included studies, the appropriateness of the synthesis
methods, the consistency of the conclusions with the findings,
and the identification and reporting of potential conflicts of
interest.



Each included review was evaluated against these criteria and
a score was assigned to reflect its overall methodological quality.
The scoring process resulted in an overall score ranging from
0% to 100%, providing a quantitative measure of quality. Higher
scores indicated reviews with robust and transparent
methodologies, while lower scores highlighted areas of potential
methodological weakness. The quality assessment was carried
out independently by 2 researchers (SW and SM) to ensure an
objective and systematic assessment. Any disagreements in the
assessment were resolved by discussion to reach consensus.
Multimedia Appendix 3 [9,10,19,27-89] provides a detailed
scoring document.


**Data Synthesis and Analysis**


We applied the NASSS (nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up,
spread, and sustainability) framework as a methodological tool
to categorize the data (Figure 1) [14]. The NASSS framework
was selected due to its ability to capture the multifaceted nature
of technology implementation in health and care settings. It
considers multiple levels of analysis to predict and evaluate the
success of technology implementation and adoption. Failures,
partial successes, and unexpected problems with technology
are explained by examining complex interactions across 7
domains: condition, technology, value proposition, adopter
system, organization, broader context, and changes over time

[14].



**Figure 1.** The NASSS (nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability) framework (adapted from Greenhalgh et al [14]).



The coding scheme was developed iteratively and refined by
consensus among 3 researchers (SW, CA, and SM). Following
the study by Kuckartz and Rädiker [90], we deductively
categorized relevant data fragments into 1 of the 7 domains of
the NASSS framework. The selected fragments were then
inductively categorized into subthemes. Rather than analyzing
each technology or care setting separately, we integrated the



identified factors into overarching categories to capture broader
implementation barriers and facilitators. This approach allowed
us to synthesize common themes across diverse technologies
and settings while still acknowledging contextual nuances.


By structuring the findings in this way, we aimed to highlight
general barriers and facilitators rather than treating each setting
or technology in isolation. We systematically mapped each code

to the corresponding domain, ensuring a structured
categorization of influencing factors. For example, factors
categorized under the “technology” domain included usability
and integration issues as barriers, whereas intuitive design and
interoperability were identified as facilitators. Similarly, the
“adopters” domain captured aspects such as technological
confidence and workload, highlighting both enabling and
inhibiting influences on DNT implementation.


### _Results_

**Characteristics of the Included Studies**


Figure 2 illustrates the selection and screening process, including
the primary reasons for exclusion. The initial search identified
4740 articles, from which 965 (20.36%) duplicates were
removed. A total of 79.64% (3775/4740) of the articles
underwent abstract screening, resulting in 4.03% (152/3775) of
full-text assessments. Of these 152 articles, 101 (66.4%) studies
were excluded due to various reasons (eg, outcome of interest
not reported and wrong study design).



**Figure 2.** PRISMA flow diagram of the study selection process. *Six articles were not systematic reviews, which only became apparent in the full-text
screening.



An updated literature screening identified an additional 1110
records, with 82 (7.39%) duplicates removed, leaving 1028
(92.61%) titles and abstracts for screening. After excluding
96.4% (991/1028) of the articles, 3.6% (37/1028) of the full
texts were assessed, of which 62% (23/37) of the studies were
excluded. Ultimately, 38% (14/37) of the additional articles
were included, leading to a total of 65 studies in this review.
Across these 65 reviews, a total of 1806 individual studies were
synthesized. The number of studies included per review ranged
from 5 to 140, with a median of 18.5 studies per review.


A total of 65 studies on DNT published between 2010 and 2024
were analyzed, with 46 (71%) studies published after 2018. The
studies were conducted in 24 countries, with most originating
from the United States (15/65, 23%), followed by Australia
(7/65, 11%), Finland (6/65, 9%), and Germany (4/65, 6%). With
regard to study types, systematic reviews dominated (26/65,
40%), followed by integrative reviews (13/65, 20%); scoping
reviews (10/65, 15%); and a smaller number (16/65, 25%) of
literature, narrative, rapid and mixed methods reviews. The
average quality rating was 92% (SD 11.3%), with 65% (42/65)
of the studies scoring 100%.



The studies focused on interventions that included technologies
from different technology categories (11/65, 17%), decision
support systems (10/65, 15%), hospital or care institution
information systems (10/65, 15%), telehealth (9/65, 14%), and
electronic medical record systems (7/65, 11%). Reviews
focusing on clinical decision support systems (10/65, 15%; 376
included studies; mean 37.6 studies per review), hospital
information systems (10/65, 15%; 295 studies; mean 29.5 studies
per review) and telehealth (9/65, 14%; 227 studies; mean 25.2
studies per review) tended to include a higher number of primary
studies. In contrast, assistive devices (5/65, 8%; 69 studies;
mean 13.8 studies per review), and tracking technologies (1/65,
2%; 8 studies; mean 8.0 studies per review) included markedly
fewer studies. Multimedia Appendix 1 provides more details
on categories and definitions of DNTs.


There was variability in the use of implementation-related
terminology and the focus of the included studies. In addition,
the study settings varied, including inpatient and outpatient
settings, such as home visiting programs, intensive care units,
and nursing homes. Refer to Table 1 for more details on the
characteristics of the included studies.

**Factors Influencing the Implementation and Adoption**
**of DNTs**


_**Overview**_


After analyzing the data, a total of 1031 segments were
identified and classified into 52 inductively generated categories
(influencing factors) within 6 domains of the NASSS
framework.


Of the 1031 segments, the “adopters” domain had the highest
number with 432 (41.9%) segments. The “condition” domain
primarily identifies factors from the patient’s perspective (Figure
1), but we have made explicit reference to the factors that have
an impact on nurses. Similarly, the “wider system” domain does
not focus directly on factors from the nurses’ perspective.
However, we have decided to include them here for the purposes
of completeness. This approach also explains the relatively
small number of factors included in these domains compared



to the others. There has been no categorization in the seventh
domain (“embedding and adaption over time;” Table 2).


It is important to note that the factors described in the included
articles were often presented as either facilitators or barriers.
For example, in the domain “technology,” the subcategory
“functionality” was reported as a barrier in almost all included
segments. A lack of user-friendly features or technical issues
can hinder the effective implementation of the technology in
practice. On the other hand, in the domain “value proposition,”
most segments in the “quality of care” subcategory were
described as a facilitating factor. However, this does not imply
that they are inherently one or the other. In fact, many factors
can be both, depending on the context. For example,
“functionality” in the domain of “technology” can be seen as a
facilitator when it works as intended, but it can become a barrier
when it malfunctions. The frequency with which certain factors
are mentioned provides insights into which domains and factors
are predominantly reported with positive or negative
experiences.

on DNT implementation.



aAbsolute and relative values refer to the individual domain in each case.
bSpecification in the coded segment as a facilitator or a barrier to implementation.
cNot applicable.



_**Adopters**_


This domain focuses on the individuals and groups who will
use or be affected by the technology, including their motivation,
capacity, and willingness to adopt.


The facilitators and barriers were identified almost equally in
this domain. Most factors fell into the categories of “training”
(58/432, 13.4%) and “workload” (54/432, 12.5%). Regarding
training, nurses’ acceptance and effectiveness in using DNTs
were strongly linked to their experience and competence in
using these technologies [67]. Adequate training and education
were considered essential to improve nurses’ competence and
reduce workload [57]. The lack of training and technological
knowledge was associated with uncertainty, frustration, and
inefficient use of technologies, such as health information
systems [70]. The need for specialized training programs tailored
to the specific needs of nurses was often highlighted [10]. The
“workload” category revealed that while technological
innovations can reduce workload by saving time, simplifying
tasks, and reducing stress [53], they can also contribute to
increased workload by introducing additional technical
requirements or redundant documentation tasks, particularly in
electronic medical record systems [61]. The “(perceived) value”
category (34/432, 7.9%) reflected mostly positive feedback, as
nurses reported feeling more confident in managing patient risks
and acknowledged that technologies, such as telemedicine [45],
improved patient safety and quality of care. However, concerns
were raised about the potential for human error and mechanical
failure in complex medical devices [33], as well as skepticism
about the cost-benefit ratio [31] and the potential impact on
quality of care [28].


_**Organization**_


This domain examines the readiness and capability of the
implementing organizations, including infrastructure, leadership,
culture, and available resources.



Most segments (154/213, 72.3%) in this domain were described
as facilitators. The category “leadership support” (55/213,
25.8%) emphasized the importance of ongoing training and IT
support for successful DNT adoption [9]. Leadership
engagement and a supportive environment were seen by nurses
as crucial for overcoming implementation challenges [48].
Nursing leadership and organizational backing that values
nurses’ input help foster a positive adoption culture [28].
Conversely, inadequate IT support and lack of investment in
infrastructure and staffing were major barriers [12]. The category
“training” (38/213, 17.8%), while also categorized under the
“adopters” domain, focuses here on organizational-level
structural and resource-related factors. Access to training and
continuous support was seen as vital for the successful
implementation and use of DNTs. Nurses emphasized the need
for dedicated time and sufficient resources for training programs

[58]. Effective training strategies, tailored to the diverse needs
of staff, including both formal and informal learning
opportunities, are crucial for building readiness and capacity
among staff [49]. However, barriers such as time constraints,
lack of support, and inadequate resources often hinder training
efforts, stressing the need for standardized, mandatory training
practices [40].


The “resources” category (25/213, 11.7%) included factors such
as policy, staffing, and financial constraints. Sufficient physical
and technical resources were considered crucial for the
sustainable integration of DNTs [49]. The barriers included staff
shortages, high costs, time limitations, and the need for
dedicated personnel to manage technologies. Moreover,
concerns about cost allocation and suboptimal resource
distribution were often reported as hindrances to effective
implementation [45,63].


_**Technology**_


This domain involves the features of the technology, including
its usability, maturity, complexity, cost, and how it fits into
existing workflows.

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Walzer et al



The assigned segments in this domain were often described as
barriers in the included literature. Most (63/208, 30.3%) of the
factors fell into the category of “user experience.” While
technologies, such as hospital information technology systems

[28] and web-based patient-professional communication [54],
were positively rated by nurses for their ease of use and intuitive
design (functional and technical characteristics of DNTs),
facilitating communication and patient care, challenges such as
poor usability of clinical decision support systems [35], general
technical issues, and time-consuming processes [59] were
identified as contributing to nurses’ stress and frustration,
ultimately impacting workflow efficiency and quality of patient
care, as described, for example, in a review of electronic health
records [56]. The category “functionality” (41/208, 19.7%) was
predominantly associated with barriers, with only 10% (4/41)
of the factors described as facilitators, for example, in the
context of clinical information systems [65]. The common
challenges included speed, connectivity, and battery life issues
associated with technologies such as intelligent physical robots

[73] and telehealth solutions [62]. In addition, system
malfunctions, software failures, and inefficient documentation
processes were frequently reported, particularly in electronic
health records [70] and digital nursing information systems [43].
The category “reliability and robustness” (28/208, 13.5%)
highlighted the critical importance of reliability in DNT for
patient safety. While advances in alarm systems [47] have
improved accuracy, challenges such as false alarms, system
failures, and unreliable equipment persist, leading to staff fatigue
and skepticism about the effectiveness of alarm technologies

[36]. Moreover, system downtimes and inaccurate patient data,
especially in telehealth applications [67], hindered overall
system reliability.


_**Value Proposition**_


This domain focuses on the perceived benefits of the
technology—for developers, health care providers, nurses, and
patients.


The assigned segments in this domain were mostly described
as facilitators (125/162, 77.2%). The category “quality of care”
(44/162, 27.2%) was the most frequently coded factor in this
domain. Nurses highlighted the benefits of medication
administration technologies [59] in improving patient safety,
particularly in reducing treatment errors and adverse events

[65]. Several studies indicated that clinical decision support
systems [75] and telehealth solutions [46] improved triage
efficiency and immediate care delivery, ultimately leading to
better patient outcomes [41]. In the “job satisfaction” category
(31/162, 19.1%), technology integration was found to contribute
to increased job satisfaction, particularly through improved
patient monitoring [36] and reduced workload and burden of
care, as observed with alarm systems [47]. These benefits
allowed nurses to spend more time on direct patient care [50]
and enhanced their competency in using DNTs [60]. However,
some concerns were raised about the compatibility of certain
digital tools with nursing workflows and a perceived lack of
understanding of their practical purpose [29]. The “efficiency
of care” category (23/162, 14.2%) reflected mixed perceptions.
While videoconferencing tools were sometimes perceived to
be less effective than face-to-face communication [68],



telehealth technologies were widely valued for their potential
to enhance care efficiency [83]. In addition, DNTs designed to
standardize care processes, such as electronic health records
and clinical information systems [35], were seen as beneficial
in streamlining care planning, assessments, and shift transitions

[50].


_**Condition**_


This domain refers to the illness or health condition being
addressed. It considers its complexity, comorbidities,
predictability, and impact on care.


A few factors (8/1031, 0.8%) were assigned to this domain, as
many identified themes focused more on organizational or
technological issues. Nonetheless, patient-related factors such
as adherence—the willingness and ability of patients to
consistently engage with digitally supported care—were
important considerations. Scheduling consultations posed
particular challenges for patients with complex, unstable, or
psychosocial conditions. Missed or delayed appointments often
reflected deeper difficulties in patient engagement and
self-management, which in turn increased the workload for
nurses who had to compensate for these gaps [44]. In addition,
some nurses expressed concerns about the limitations of
web-based consultations for detecting deterioration in patients
with complex or high-risk conditions. This raised questions
about whether DNTs can reliably support safe care for these
vulnerable groups [40].


_**Wider System**_


This domain considers external influences, such as policies,
regulations, standards, and broader sociopolitical and economic
factors.


For the same reason as in the “condition” domain, very few
factors were assigned in this domain overall (8/1013, 0.8%).
Nevertheless, the factors identified are critical to understanding
the barriers to successful DNTs implementation and adoption.
The category with the most negative factors was “governance
involvement” (4/8, 50%), which highlighted several systemic
barriers to the integration and widespread adoption of DNTs.
A recurring theme was the lack of sufficient funding and unclear
reimbursement models, which created uncertainty for health
care providers and organizations regarding the financial
sustainability of DNT programs [71]. In addition, the lack of
regulatory guidelines regarding the integration of DNTs into
existing systems and liability for medical errors was another
critical barrier. Health care providers expressed concerns about
how liability would be handled in the event of errors during
virtual care, for example, making them reluctant to fully embrace
the technology [71]. Another issue was uncertainty about the
return on investment from implementing DNTs, which led to
hesitation among stakeholders who were unsure of the long-term
benefits. External environmental factors, such as government
support and general public opinion about the effectiveness of
remote technologies, also influenced the rate of DNTs adoption

[34].

### _Discussion_

**Principal Findings**


In this umbrella review, we synthesized evidence from the
existing systematic reviews that discuss facilitators and barriers
to the implementation and adoption of DNTs. We identified
1031 segments and 52 inductively generated categories within
the 6 domains of the NASSS framework, highlighting the key
factors influencing implementation. The review shows
increasing research interest in DNTs, especially after 2018
(46/65, 71%), with most conducted in Western
countries—predominantly the United States (16/65, 25%). The
research focused on electronic health records, clinical decision
support systems, and telehealth, while robotics and automation
received less attention.


Nurses represent nearly 45% of the global health workforce and
frequently act as the link between patients, technologies, and
organizational structures. Their acceptance and engagement are
therefore critical to successful implementation and adoption.
While prior reviews take a general or physician-centered
approach [91,92], our nursing-specific focus uncovers unique
facilitators and barriers—such as professional identity,
autonomy, and relational care—that are commonly overlooked.
We believe these insights are essential not only for enhancing
DNT implementation in nursing practice but also for providing
valuable guidance for developers, policy makers, and health
care teams working toward sustainable adoption.


We categorized the identified factors into overarching themes
instead of focusing on specific technologies or settings, enabling
synthesis across contexts while preserving nuance. However,
certain technologies (eg, direct patient interaction vs
infrastructure tools) pose unique challenges. Nurses’needs vary
by care setting, influencing how often facilitators and barriers
appear across NASSS domains. Some factors even act as both
facilitators and barriers. This uneven distribution suggests some
domains may be more central to implementation than others.


To increase the likelihood of sustainable implementation and
adoption of DNTs, it is recommended that the specific needs
of the technology and the setting be considered [17-20], as
highlighted in the “technology” and “organization” domains,
where usability, infrastructure, and contextual factors varied
significantly. Abell et al [93], in a recent scoping review,
explored the barriers and facilitators to implementing
computerized clinical decision support systems in hospitals.
Their review included a broad range of health care professionals,
such as physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and pharmacists.
Although their focus was limited to one type of technology,
their findings—structured using the NASSS framework—align
with ours. This supports both the applicability of the NASSS
framework in analyzing implementation challenges and the
presence of generic influencing factors relevant across different
DNTs. Tan et al [94], in another scoping review, examined the
factors influencing the implementation and adoption of
telehealth in nursing home settings. They identified critical
factors, such as availability of technical infrastructure, staff
training and acceptance, financial considerations, and leadership
support. The authors highlight the complexity of implementing



telehealth in care settings and the need to address these
determinants to ensure successful implementation. In addition,
in the context of informal dementia care, the results of a
comprehensive review by Bastoni et al [95] on the factors
influencing the implementation of eHealth technologies show
similar findings to our work. The results of these studies [93-95]
show that the factors influencing the implementation and
adoption of DNTs found in our study can be applied (to a limited
extent) to other health care professions and settings. This
perspective is supported by several studies in the literature. For
instance, Borges do Nascimento et al [92] identified key barriers,
such as inadequate infrastructure, increased workload,
insufficient training, and legal-ethical concerns. Conversely,
they highlighted robust institutional training, governmental
support, and involving health care professionals in technology
development as crucial facilitators—especially when
technologies are intuitively designed and their benefits are
evident.


Most factors (432/1031, 41.9%) identified in the included studies
relate to the “adopters” domain, underscoring the importance
of addressing these barriers and facilitators. Adequate training
and education on DNT use are crucial for the successful
implementation. Similar conclusions have been drawn in studies
on digital transformation in nursing education [11]. Current
research highlights several issues: a lack of objective tools to
assess digital competencies [96,97], insufficient training that
addresses varying competencies [98,99], and limited
implementation knowledge [6,99]. The NASSS framework
helped structure these findings across individual, organizational,
and systemic levels, enabling a holistic view of training-related
challenges. Well-trained nurses can help address these
issues—an approach supported by recent reviews as a key to
overcoming barriers and fostering DNT adoption [100].


Our review highlighted the importance of structural and
resource-related factors within health care organizations in
shaping nurses’ experiences with technology implementation.
Leadership support was consistently identified as a key
facilitator. Nurses emphasized the role of organizational leaders
who ensured ongoing education, IT support, and a supportive
work environment in fostering a positive culture for adoption.
Nursing leadership, in particular, was seen as crucial in
addressing challenges, advocating for staff needs, and enabling
integration into clinical routines. In contrast, lack of support,
poor IT infrastructure, and staffing shortages were frequently
cited as major barriers. These findings align with the previous
research emphasizing the necessity of organizational
commitment for the sustained adoption of DNTs [101].


The value of DNTs largely depends on their impact on the
quality of care [59]. Manufacturer promises often do not reflect
nurses’ perceptions. Acceptance increases when nurses are
involved in the design and implementation. For instance,
bed-exit systems aim to prevent falls but may cause alarm
fatigue [13], illustrating the need for usability that fits nursing
workflows. Misalignment often stems from development driven
by biomedical and economic perspectives, overlooking nursing
priorities [14]. Nurses appear to prioritize tools and systems
that improve patient outcomes, streamline processes, and
ultimately contribute to better patient care. Conversely, when

technology complicates workflow or detracts from direct patient
interaction, its perceived value diminishes, regardless of the
other benefits it may provide (eg, improved efficiency).
Therefore, the successful implementation and adoption of
technology in the care setting depends on its ability to positively
impact the quality of care provided [14]. Integrating
participatory design approaches (co-design) in the development
phase could help ensure that new digital tools meet the practical
needs of nurses and enhance their usability [102].


In our study, the “condition” domain yielded little information,
which aligns with our nursing-specific focus—most relevant
factors were classified under the “adopters” domain. Similarly,
few aspects were related to the “wider system” domain, and
none were associated with the “embedding over time” domain,
consistent with the findings of Bastoni et al [95]. This gap
reflects the dominance of short-term, small-scale studies that
often lack structured implementation frameworks. However,
understanding how DNTs are sustained, adapted, or discontinued

**Implications for practice**



over time is essential for assessing their long-term impact.
Without longitudinal perspectives, true integration of DNTs
into nursing practice remains unclear. This requires targeted
funding, stronger academic-practice partnerships, and wider
use of frameworks that address sustainability explicitly.


Political and regulatory factors play an important role in shaping
the digital transformation of health care. The lack of clear
regulatory guidelines, reimbursement policies, and national
funding programs can hinder the widespread adoption of DNTs.
Policy makers should focus on creating standardized frameworks
that facilitate implementation while ensuring data security,
liability clarity, and financial incentives for health care
institutions [103].


**Implications for Practice and Research**


This review highlights several critical factors influencing the
successful implementation and adoption of DNTs in health care
settings, offering clear directions for both practice and research
(Textbox 2).




 - Ensure strong leadership support to foster a positive organizational culture for digital nursing technology (DNT) implementation and adoption.

 - Provide tailored training programs that meet the specific digital competency needs of nurses.

 - Guarantee adequate IT infrastructure, staffing, and ongoing technical support.

 - Promote collaboration among key stakeholders (eg, nurses, nursing leadership, IT specialists, and administrators) during all phases of
implementation.


 - Integrate DNTs in a way that aligns with nursing workflows and supports professional autonomy and relational care.


**Implications for research**


 - Apply structured implementation frameworks (eg, NASSS [nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability]) in future studies
to better understand how various factors influence DNT adoption across technologies, settings, and user groups.


 - Conduct longitudinal research to explore how DNTs are sustained, adapted, or discontinued over time and across different institutional contexts.

 - Develop practical, user-friendly tools to support researchers and practitioners during the implementation process, as current instruments (eg,
NASSS Complexity Assessment Tool [104]) often lack ease of use.



**Strengths and Limitations**


Using a sensitive search strategy, we synthesized a substantial
knowledge base through a comprehensive examination of
reviews. Furthermore, the strength of our review lies in the use
of the NASSS framework as a deductive categorization system

[14]. However, it is imperative to acknowledge specific
limitations. Our findings are context-specific to formal care,
and their applicability to other implementation contexts may
vary. While there is overlap with other professions and settings,
it is important to note that different technologies present their
own unique challenges that may not have been fully captured
in this broader analysis. Although common themes were
identified across technologies, each technology may present its
own set of barriers and facilitators that were not always
addressed in this review, which may affect the applicability of
the findings to specific technology contexts.


Another limitation is that although we searched 4 highly relevant
databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Business
Source Premier), we cannot ensure that we included all existing



reviews in our study. The selection of these databases was based
on their relevance to the research topic and their coverage of
health sciences, systematic reviews, and business literature.
However, we acknowledge that the exclusion of broader
databases, such as Scopus or Google Scholar, and other
discipline-specific databases, such as PsycINFO or Embase,
may have limited the scope of our search and resulted in the
omission of relevant studies. In addition, we included only
German and English manuscripts, which may introduce a
potential regional bias by excluding studies published in other
languages, such as French, Chinese, or Spanish. Although this
decision was based on the linguistic expertise of the research
team, we acknowledge that a fully comprehensive picture of
the global landscape of DNT adoption and implementation could
not be achieved, and it may limit the transferability of our
findings to other cultural and linguistic contexts.


The quality of the included studies was assessed using the
Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for
Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses [27]. As most

studies were narrative reviews with a qualitative focus, purely
quantitative quality metrics were less applicable. Instead, we
prioritized methodological transparency, including clear research
questions, a rigorous study selection process, and transparent
analysis. Given the qualitative nature of these reviews, we
focused on coherence, relevance, and clarity in the synthesis of
findings rather than statistical measures. After careful
consideration, we included all reviews in the synthesis while
ensuring transparency in the quality assessment. However, the
varying quality of the included reviews may have influenced
the strength and reliability of the synthesized findings.


Finally, it is important to acknowledge the potential publication
bias, as only published reviews were included in our synthesis.
Although we made a high effort (including a search update) to
ensure a comprehensive search, the exclusion of unpublished
or gray literature may have led to an overrepresentation of
certain outcomes and potentially biased the results.

**Conclusions**


This umbrella review provides a comprehensive synthesis of
the facilitators and barriers to the implementation and adoption
of DNTs. It highlights the complex interplay of organizational,
individual, and systemic factors that influence the successful
integration of new technologies into care processes. Leadership
support, adequate training, and alignment with care needs
emerge as key enablers, while insufficient resources,
infrastructure limitations, and workflow incompatibilities remain
substantial barriers. The findings underscore the importance of
addressing both the specific technology requirements and the
unique needs of the health care environment to ensure the
successful implementation of DNTs. Future research should
focus on long-term studies and the development of practical
tools to support hospital stakeholders—such as nurses,
management, and IT departments—in effectively adopting
DNTs. This will help to sustainably embed DNTs in nursing
practice and increase their long-term impact.
