## CONTEXT: Provider-based human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine promotion interventions have abstract

been widely implemented; however, the effectiveness of these approaches is unclear.


OBJECTIVES: This systematic review assessed the effects and costs of provider-based
interventions designed to increase HPV vaccination coverage. A meta-analysis was conducted
to estimate pooled effect sizes of the interventions.


DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library.


STUDY SELECTION: We identified articles on provider-based HPV vaccine promotion interventions
published in English between 2007 and 2021.


DATA EXTRACTION: Information about the interventions’ effects and costs was extracted from the
studies. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled intervention effects, including
changes in the HPV vaccine initiation rate, HPV vaccine completion rate, and the percentage of
patients receiving the next needed dose.


RESULTS: We identified 32 studies of provider-based interventions to improve the HPV
vaccination rate. The reported intervention strategies included provider training, provider
reminders, and provider assessment and feedback. In the meta-analysis, we found significant
improvements in the HPV vaccine initiation rate (3.7%) and the percentage of patients
receiving the next needed dose (9.4%).


LIMITATIONS: Because of the limited number of studies, we were unable to compare the same
outcomes between different provider-based approaches. We found the high heterogeneity
across studies. The random effects method was applied to adjust for study heterogeneity, the
heterogeneity remined high for certain outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS: Provider-based interventions were effective in improving HPV vaccination rates.
Sustainability and continuous implementation are the central factors that contributed to
intervention success.

The human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccine is recommended for all
adolescents and young adults aged
9 through 26 to prevent HPV-related
diseases. However, HPV vaccination
coverage in the United States is
suboptimal. According to recent
data, only 58.6% of adolescents
aged 13 to 17 years were up-to-date
with the HPV vaccine series (HPV
UTD) in 2020, [1] which is well below
the national Healthy People 2030
goal of 80%. [2] Studies have found
that health care providers play
central roles in improving parents’
and adolescents’ HPV vaccination
awareness and intention. Thus, to
increase HPV vaccination coverage
rates, provider-targeted
interventions, including provider
assessment and feedback,
reminders, and training, have been
widely implemented. These
interventions aim to improve health
care providers’ intentions and
abilities to recommend the
vaccination to the target population.
A prior systematic review concluded
that health care providers’
recommendations significantly
improved parents’ attitudes toward
and acceptance of HPV vaccination. [3]

Another study used National
Immunization Survey-Teen data to
estimate parental intent for HPV
vaccination; parents were more
likely to initiate HPV vaccination of
adolescents if they received a
recommendation from a health care
provider. [4]


Despite the key role of health care
providers’ recommendations, the
effects of provider-based
intervention designed to improve
the HPV vaccination rate are
unknown. A previous systematic
review identified interventions
designed to improve HPV
vaccination rates. [5] However, they
only included studies used patient
education to improve the HPV
vaccination coverage; the effects of
provider-based approach was



unknown. Two reviews identified
studies focusing on HPV vaccine
promotion interventions and used
meta-analysis to estimate the pooled
effect on HPV vaccination rates.
However, these studies included
both community-based and
provider-based interventions, so the
effectiveness of provider-based
interventions could not be
distinguished. [6,7] In this systematic
review and meta-analysis, we
identified studies that used
provider-based interventions to
improve HPV vaccination coverage,
summarized the evidence of the
interventions’ effect, and estimated
the pooled effects of the
interventions stratified by outcome
measurements.


METHODS


Search Strategy and Data
Extraction


We used PubMed, Medline, Embase,
and the Cochrane Library to identify
articles addressing provider-based
interventions for increasing HPV
vaccination coverage published from
January 1, 2007 to December 31,
2021. Three key Medical Subject
Heading terms were used for the
search: “HPV or human
papillomavirus,” “vaccine or
vaccination,” and “intervention.” All
studies were screened by title and
abstract by 2 authors (C.W. and D.L.)
independently. All the literature
identified in previously published
systematic reviews was also
included to ensure a comprehensive
review. [6][–][8] The relevant search
literature was imported to RefWork
(ProQuest) for citation management,
data selection, and duplicate checks.
Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses guidelines were used to
conduct this review. [9] Extracted data
included the following elements:
title, author, year of publication,
characteristics of the target
population, sample size, intervention



design and setting, study design
(involved randomization or not),
outcome measurements, intervention
effects, and costs (if available). The
study characteristics and key findings
were summarized according to the
interventional approach(es) used.


Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria


Studies that met the following
inclusion criteria were included in
the review.


1. Studies that examined the impact
of interventions that included
provider-based approaches to
increase HPV vaccination
coverage.
2. Studies that quantitatively measured
differences or changes in HPV
vaccination coverage after a
provider-based intervention.
3. Studies with either randomized
controlled trial (RCT) or pre and
post designs.
4. Studies of interventions conducted
in the United States.


Studies with any of the following
characteristics were excluded.


1. Studies in which data showing
changes in HPV vaccination rates
were not available or were not
reported quantitatively.
2. Studies that measured changes
in HPV vaccination knowledge,
attitude, or intent after the
intervention, but not changes in
vaccine coverage.
3. Studies that did not report original
research or were not available in
English.


Risk of Bias Assessment


The risk of bias of the studies was
evaluated using bias assessment
tools. RCTs were evaluated using the
Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2). [10]

RoB 2 assesses the risk of bias in
5 domains: the randomization
process, intervention deliveries,
missing outcome data, outcome
measurements, and reported results.

about vaccination coverage or missed
opportunity percentages were shared
with the participating providers,
and the providers’ performance in
delivering the vaccine to the target
population was periodically
evaluated. In some cases, incentives
were given if the health care
providers reached the desired
vaccination coverage target.


Two studies used provider
assessment and feedback alone, [12,27]

both of which focused on 11- to
18-year-old adolescents. One study
assessed the effectiveness of a
program that included in-person
and virtual provider assessment and
feedback, incentives, and sharing of
vaccination coverage differences
between the intervention and
control groups. That study found
that HPV vaccine completion rates
in the 11- to 12-year-old female
participants were not significantly
different between the intervention
and control groups. Among the 13- to
18-year-old female participants,
however, the change in the HPV
vaccine completion rate after
providers underwent the in-person
assessment and feedback intervention
was significantly larger than that in
the control group. [12] The other study
examined the effects of assessment
and feedback interventions in primary
care clinics. Little change was
observed in HPV vaccine initiation
rates at 12 months after the providerbased intervention. [27]


Sixteen studies applied interventions
that combined provider assessment
and feedback with other approaches
to improve HPV vaccination
coverage. [20][–][24,26,29][–][31,34][–][36,39][–][41,43]

The reported results of the effects of
these interventions were mixed. Five
studies examined the effects of a
combination of provider assessment
and feedback with provider
training. [20][–][23,39] Three of these studies
found that the HPV vaccination
coverage rate did not significantly
differ between intervention and



For cluster randomized trials,
cluster RoB 2 was used, which adds
an additional domain: the timing of
identification or recruitment of
participants in the trial. Each
domain was judged as having “a low
risk of bias,” “some concerns,” or “a
high risk of bias.” An overall risk of
bias judgement was created based
on the assessments of each domain.


For nonrandomized studies, we used
the Risk Of Bias in Nonrandomized
Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I)
tool to assess the risk of bias. [11]

ROBINS-I is structured into 7
domains: bias because of
confounding, bias in selection of
participants in the study, bias in
classification of interventions, bias
because of deviations from intended
interventions, bias because of missing
data, bias in measurement of
outcomes, and bias in selection of the
reported result. Each domain was
judged as having “low risk of bias,”
“moderate risk of bias,” “serious risk
of bias,” “critical risk of bias,” or “no
information.” The overall risk of bias
was assessed based on the
assessments of each domain.


Meta-analysis


A meta-analysis was used to
estimate the pooled effects of the
interventions. The meta-analysis
was conducted for outcomes
reported in 3 or more independent
studies. The analysis was stratified
by the outcomes measured. In the
primary analysis, we excluded
uncontrolled pre and post studies. In
the secondary analysis, studies that
did not involve randomization were
excluded. As a result, we included 3
outcomes: HPV vaccine series
initiation rate, HPV vaccine series
completion rate, and the percentage
of vaccine recipients who received
their next needed HPV vaccine dose.
Forest plots showing the effects of
each intervention were constructed.
The I [2] statistic was used to represent
consistency of the results.



RESULTS


Basic Characteristics of Included
Studies


A total of 4383 articles were
identified by the initial searches of
the databases. After applying the
inclusion and exclusion criteria,
32 studies were included in the
review. The literature selection
process is illustrated in Fig 1. Study
characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. Three provider-based
strategies were identified in the
included studies: provider
reminders, provider assessment and
feedback, and provider training. The
age of the target populations in the
included studies ranged from 9 to
26 years. Fifteen studies involved
random assignment of interventions
to eligible clinics or individuals. [12][–][26]

The control condition in most of the
randomized studies was usual care
without any intervention. One study
has 2 different control groups;
1 is the historical control which
vaccination data were collected by
3-years before the implementation
and another is the usual care. [13] Three
studies did not have the control
group as they compared the
outcomes across multiple intervention
approaches [20,21] or pre and
postintervention. [25] Among studies
that did not involve randomization,
10 studies assessed the intervention’s
effectiveness before and after its
implementation, [27][–][36] and 6 studies
compared the intervention’s effects
between groups that received or did
not receive the intervention. [37][–][42] One
study compared the HPV vaccination
coverage with the national rates. [43]


Studies Evaluating Provider
Assessment and Feedback
Interventions


Eighteen studies applied provider
assessment and feedback to
improve HPV vaccination
coverage. [12,20][–][24,26,27,29][–][31,34][–][36,39][–][41,43]

This was the most common strategy
among the included interventions. In
these interventions, information

control groups. [20,22,39] Two studies
showed that the HPV vaccine series
initiation rate among both sexes was
significantly higher in the intervention
groups than in the control groups. [21,23]

Seven studies used a patient reminder
and recall system in addition to the
provider assessment and feedback
method. [24,30,31,34,35,40,41] Five of these
studies concluded that the combined
intervention effectively improved the
HPV vaccination rate, [24,30,31,34,40]

whereas 2 studies found that HPV
vaccine rates were similar in groups
with and without the intervention. [35,41]

Three studies used patient education
plus provider assessment and
feedback. [26,31,40] Findings of these
studies indicated that HPV vaccine
series completion rates increased by
4% to 20% following the
interventions. Finally, 1 study
reported an intervention combining
provider assessment and feedback,



standing orders for HPV vaccination,
and immunization information
systems and found that the HPV
vaccine series completion rate
increased by about 1% after the
intervention. [36]


Studies Evaluating Provider
Reminder Interventions


Eleven studies assessed the effects of
interventions involving provider
reminders in improving HPV
vaccination coverage. [13][–][16,24,25,28][–][30,33,42]

The studied interventions used
electronic health record systems or
patient charts to deliver reminders to
physicians when an adolescent patient
was due for HPV vaccination. On the
whole, the studies showed mixed
results regarding HPV vaccination rate
improvement. Six studies used provider
reminders alone. [13][–][16,28,42] Of these, 1
study compared the effects of
implementing an electronic prompt



system for providers and found that
the percentage of patients receiving at
least 1 dose of the HPV vaccine was
significantly higher in the intervention
group (35.0%) than that in the control
group (21.3%). [42] Another study
assessed the effects of electronic
provider prompts for HPV vaccination
in postpartum women. The HPV
vaccine uptake rate increased from
1.2% at baseline to 26.5% after the
intervention. [28] However, in a study
evaluating 2 provider reminder
strategies, electronic record prompts
and paper-based notices, both methods
had limited effects on the vaccination
completion rate. [13] Two of the studies
on provider reminders alone focused
on 11- to 17-year-old adolescents [14,15] ;
in both, the differences in the
vaccination rates between the
intervention and control groups did not
reach statistical significance.


Five studies combined provider
reminders with other interventions,
including provider assessment and
feedback, interventions designed to
reduce patients’ out-of-pocket costs,
provider training, patient education,
patient reminder and recall systems,
and standing orders. [24,25,29,30,33] One
such study focused on hospitalized
pediatric patients. In that study, of
34 HPV vaccine doses required for
catch-up among under immunized
adolescents, only 7 doses were
administered. [25] An intervention
bundling a provider reminder with
provider assessment and feedback
and reducing patient out-of-pocket
costs was implemented in obstetrics
and gynecology clinics and focused
on young adult women. This study
found that the intervention bundle
effectively reduced the rate of
missed opportunities for
vaccination. [29] Other studies also
concluded that combination
intervention that included provider
reminders significantly improved
HPV vaccination coverage. [24,30,33]

Studies Evaluating Provider Training
Interventions


Twelve studies reported on the use
of provider training to improve HPV
vaccination coverage. [17][–][23,32,33,37][–][39]

These trainings focused on providing
background knowledge about HPV
vaccination and helping health care
providers develop more effective
communication strategies for
recommending HPV vaccination to
parents of eligible adolescents. We
found 3 studies in which provider
training alone was used. [17,18,37] One
study compared HPV vaccination rates
between patients whose providers
participated in announcement
training, conversation training, or no
training. In announcement training,
the provider was trained to give a
brief statement to remind parents that
their child was due for HPV
vaccination. Conversation training was
designed to help providers engage in
more open-ended discussions of HPV
vaccination with parents. This study
found that announcement training, but
not the conversation training, improved
the HPV vaccine initiation rate among
adolescents. [17] Another study evaluated
the effects of a virtual provider
training intervention (an online course
with e-mail and text-message
reinforcement). The authors concluded
that the intervention was helpful in
improving the HPV vaccine initiation
rate, particularly for well-child visits. [18]



Nine studies considered combinations
of provider training with other
interventions. [19][–][23,32,33,38,39] Provider
assessment and feedback was the
most common approach that was
combined with provider training. [20][–][23,39]

Two studies concluded that such
interventions increased the HPV
vaccination rate. [21,23] Two studies
involving combinations of provider
training and patient education focused
on specific populations, including
Appalachian [19] and African American
and Hispanic populations. [38] In the
study focusing on African American
and Hispanic patients, the researchers
found that patients in the intervention
group had a significantly higher HPV
vaccine initiation rate than the control
group. However, the HPV vaccine
completion rate in the intervention
group was lower than that of the
control group. [38] In the study focusing
on patients in Appalachian Ohio, the
combined intervention increased the
HPV vaccine initiation rate; however,
the overall vaccine uptake rate
remained low. [19]


Costs of Implementing Providerbased Interventions


We identified 2 studies that
reported the costs of implementing
provider-based interventions
(Table 2). [24,44] One study estimated
the total cost of implementing an
intervention, including educational
reminders, electronic alerts, and



clinician performance assessment
and feedback. Twenty-two primary
care practices were randomly
assigned to receive clinician-focused,
family-focused, or a combination of
clinician- and family-focused
interventions. The implementation
costs included programming costs,
feedback report delivery, and
provision of training. The
intervention that combined both
clinician-focused and family-focused
interventions had the highest total
cost. With this combination
intervention, the total cost of
administration of HPV vaccine doses
1, 2, and 3 were $3843, $3061, and
$3043, respectively. [24] The other
study evaluated a provider
assessment and feedback program
delivered either in person or by
webinar. The costs included
personnel, travel, mail delivery, and
technology system license
purchases. The implementation cost
per clinic was $152 for in-person
consultations and $100 for webinar
consultations. [44] Both studies
concluded that the interventions
were affordable and feasible.


Risk of Bias Assessments


Among the 15 studies that involved
randomization, 9 were judged to
have a low risk of bias, [12,14][–][19,24,26]

and 6 were judged to have
some concerns (Supplemental
Table 3). [13,20][–][23,25] The primary

source of bias was the
randomization process. Among the
17 nonrandomized studies for which
we applied ROBINS-I to assess study
quality, 3 studies were judged to
have a low risk of bias, [31,35,42]

11 had a moderate risk of
bias, [17,29,30,33,34,36,38][–][41,43] and 3 had
serious risk of bias (Supplemental
Table 4). [27,28,32] The primary sources



of bias were the domains of study
confounding and participant selection.


Meta-analysis


Ten studies were included in the
meta-analysis. [14,15,18,19,23,24,26,37,38,40]

Three outcomes were examined: (1)
improvement in the HPV vaccination
initiation rate, (2) improvement in
the HPV vaccination completion



rate, and (3) improvement in the
percentage of patients receiving
their next needed HPV vaccine dose.
Studies that did not report the
number of participants who
received the HPV vaccine were
excluded. Based on a prior
systematic review of HPV
vaccination improvement
interventions, we assumed that the
heterogeneity of the intervention
effects across studies was large [7] ;
therefore, the random-effects model
was applied to estimate the pooled
effect sizes.


Improvements in HPV Vaccine Initiation

Rates


Sevn studies were included in
the meta-analysis estimating
pooled effects on improvements
in HPV vaccine initiation rates. [14,18,]

19,24,26,37,40 The results of the
random-effect meta-analysis
indicated a statistically significant
difference in the HPV vaccine
initiation rate (pooled effect size 5
3.7%; 95% confidence interval

[CI] 5 1.2% to 6.2%; P < .01)
(Fig 2A). However, the results were
not consistent across studies
(I [2] 5 97.5%). [45] In a secondary
analysis in which we excluded 5
non-RCTs, [14,18,19,24,26] the
improvement in the HPV vaccine
initiation rate was 4.1% (95% CI 5
2.0% to 6.1%; P < .01).
Heterogeneity remained high in this
subgroup meta-analysis
(I [2] [5 89.4%) (Supplemental Fig 3).](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1542/peds.2022-058029/-/DCSupplemental)


Improvements in HPV Vaccination Com
pletion Rates


We identified 5 studies that
compared HPV vaccine completion
rates between intervention and
control groups. [14,19,26,38,40] The
pooled effect size estimated from
the random effects model was 1.9%
(95% CI 5 �1.4% to 5.3%), but this
effect was not statistically significant
(P 5 .26) (Fig 2B). I [2] was 93.7%,
indicating considerable
heterogeneity. When we included

only the 3 RCTs, [14,19,26] the pooled
effect estimate was 0.9% (95%
CI 5 �1.0% to 2.8%; P 5 .35).
Heterogeneity was found to be
moderate in this subgroup
(I [2] [5 52.0%) (Supplemental Fig 4).](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1542/peds.2022-058029/-/DCSupplemental)


Improvements in Receipt of the Next

Needed Dose


We identified 4 studies that
measured improvements in the
percentage of patients who received
their next needed vaccine dose. [15,18,23,]

38 The percentage of receiving the next
needed HPV vaccine dose was defined
as the number of adolescents who
received a subsequent dose among
eligible adolescents. The pooled effect
size was 9.4% (95% CI 5 4.8% to
14.0%; P < .01). I [2] was 94%,
indicating considerable heterogeneity
(Fig 2C). In the secondary analysis of
the 3 RCTs only, [15,18,23] the pooled
effect was 9.15% (95% CI 5 4.1% to
14.2%; P < .01). Heterogeneity
remained high in the subgroup
meta-analysis (I [2] 5 94.8%)
[(Supplemental Fig 5).](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1542/peds.2022-058029/-/DCSupplemental)


DISCUSSION


We identified 32 studies that used
provider-based intervention to
improve HPV vaccination coverage.
These interventions involved the
provision of education, training, and
reminders as well as evaluations of
and feedback on providers’
performance in encouraging
vaccination. Some interventions
consisted of a single strategy,
whereas others combined 2 or more
strategies. Previous systematic
reviews identified several HPV
vaccine promotion interventions but
did not arrive at conclusive findings
about the pooled effects. [6,7] To the
best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to focus on interventions
conducted at the health care
provider level and to estimate the
pooled effects of these interventions
on various HPV vaccine uptake
outcomes. Our study provides useful
information on the effectiveness and



feasibility of implementing providerbased interventions to increase HPV
vaccination coverage rates.


Providers’ recommendations have
been strongly associated with parents’
intent to initiate the HPV vaccine
series. A study that used the 2017 to
2018 National Immunization SurveyTeen to assess parental intent for
their children to receive the HPV
vaccine in the United States found
that parents who received HPV
vaccine recommendations were more
likely to initiate HPV vaccinations. [4]

Another study found that adolescents
who had not visited a physician in the
past year were less likely to initiate
the HPV vaccine than were
adolescents who had more than
1 physician visit in the past year. [46]

However, although provider
recommendations play a key role in
parents’ and adolescents’ decisionmaking about HPV vaccination, we
found that the effects of providerbased interventions were mixed.


One reason for these mixed results
may be that 1-time or short-term
interventions are not enough to
achieve HPV vaccination goals,
especially for the completion rates.
In our meta-analysis, we found there
was little improvement in HPV
vaccine series completion rates.
Studies have indicated the short
time frame of the intervention
implementation is a cause of the
series completion failure. [13,17] For
example, an individual who initiated
the HPV vaccine would need at least
6-month span to complete the HPV
vaccine series. It is impossible to
observe differences in HPV series
completion if the study follow-up
period is shorter than 6 months. To
sustain the intervention gains,
continuously implemented and
longitudinally structured
interventions are needed. In
addition, the study found the
parents and patients who missed
the opportunity to complete the
vaccine series were not aware of the



multiple visits it required. [40] Since
HPV vaccination requires parents
and adolescents to arrange and
attend multiple physician visits to
complete the vaccination series in
the recommended time frame,
sending reminders scheduling the
following appointment is suggested
to address the issue.


In addition to physicians’
recommendations, other
intervention strategies designed to
address parents’ or adolescents’
barriers to HPV vaccination are also
needed. [46] Primary reasons cited by
parents for not having their children
receive HPV vaccination include lack
of information, lack of a physician’s
recommendation, concerns about
the vaccine’s safety, and concerns
about the cost of the vaccinations. [47]

Thus, strategies aiming to reduce
knowledge gaps and financial
difficulties should be involved in the
implementation. Interventions
involving repeated contacts and
reminders are also suggested to
complement provider
recommendations.


Although most studies found
provider-based interventions to be
feasible, several challenges were
identified in the reviewed studies.
First, intervention implementation
teams faced challenges in
coordinating clinic staff, given their
many completing priorities and
limited time with patients during
each visit. [48] The design of future
interventions should consider the
efficiency of the intervention
processes and minimizing
disruptions of the clinic workflow to
gain the support of clinical staff. [27,38]

Second, health care providers did
not adhere to the interventions.
Some studies found that physicians
sometimes choose to ignore
prompts provided by the electronic
health record system even when
they were aware of the
intervention. [14,15] Including
components that help health care

providers to respond to the
immunization prompts, such as
performance incentives or vaccine
data feedback, is suggested to
improve providers’ adherence to
interventions. Third, electronic
health record systems presented
significant challenges to
implementation of interventions.
Some electronic health record
systems were unable to generate
complete immunization data, to
determine patients’ vaccine status
accurately, or to correctly track
providers’ performance, which
hindered the implementation of the
intervention. [21]


We identified 2 studies that
reported the cost of implementing
the interventions. [24,44] Different cost
measurement methods were used in
these studies; therefore, we were
unable to draw conclusive results.
Unlike the community-based
intervention, which spent the most
on personnel, [49] we found that
information technology was the
primary intervention cost; both
provider reminders and provider
assessment and feedback
interventions require technological
devices. Gilkey et al [44] reported that
the annual cost of a software license
used to generate provider
performance reports was $390. In
another study, the 1-time cost of
technology adoption was $19 096,
although these costs might be lower
when they are split across a long
period. [24] Thus, decision-makers
need to consider their cost
structures, budgets, and available
personnel to identify the most cost



effective and feasible approach. Our
findings also highlight the
importance of disclosing cost
information in future studies.


There are limitations to this study.
First, pooled intervention effects
could not be stratified by approach
and outcome measurements (eg,
HPV vaccine initiation rate by
provider reminder, provider
assessment and feedback, and
provider training) because of the
limited number of studies in each
group. Therefore, we were unable to
compare the same outcomes
between different provider-based
approaches. Continuous efforts to
collect this type of evidence are
required in future studies. Similarly,
we were unable to distinguish the
separate effects of each component
in interventions that involved more
than 1 component. A second
limitation was the high heterogeneity
across studies. This heterogeneity
may have been attributable to
variations in intervention effects and
cohort sizes across studies. Although
we applied outcome stratifications
and the random effects method to
adjust for study heterogeneity, the
heterogeneity remined high for
certain outcomes. Thirdly, we were
unable to draw the conclusive results
of effects on the percentages were up
to date with HPV vaccination and the
implementation costs as the limited
evidence identified by our search.
However, this highlights the urgent
needs about identifying the cost
information and the intervention
effect of the HPV UTD in the future
study.



In conclusion, this study provides an
evidence-based synthesis of the
impact of provider-based
interventions aimed at improving
HPV vaccination coverage rates.
Most studies suggest that
implementation of such
interventions is both feasible and
effective. Our meta-analysis
demonstrated that provider-based
interventions significantly improved
HPV vaccination initiation rates and
the percentages of patients receiving
the next required vaccine dose. To
achieve targeted HPV vaccination
rates, the sustainability of
interventions must be considered.
Other components that address
individuals’ barriers to HPV
vaccination should also be involved
to complement provider
recommendations.
