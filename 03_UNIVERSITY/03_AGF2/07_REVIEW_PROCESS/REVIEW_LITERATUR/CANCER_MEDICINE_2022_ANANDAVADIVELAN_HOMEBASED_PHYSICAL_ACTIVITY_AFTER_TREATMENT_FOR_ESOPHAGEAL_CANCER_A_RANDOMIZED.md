**Abstract**
**Background:** The treatment of most esophageal cancer patients includes
chemo(radio)therapy and extensive surgery, causing physical decline with loss of
muscles. This trial aimed to test the hypothesis that a tailored home-­based physical activity (PA) intervention improves muscle strength and mass in patients having undergone curative treatment for esophageal cancer.
**Methods:** Patients operated for esophageal cancer 1 year earlier were included in
a nationwide randomized controlled trial in Sweden in 2016–­2020. The intervention group was randomized to a 12-­week home-­based exercise program, while
the control group was encouraged to maintain routine daily PA. The primary
outcomes were changes in maximal/average hand grip strength measured with
hand grip dynamometer and lower extremity strength measured using 30-­second
chair stand test and muscle mass measured using a portable bio-­impedance analysis monitor. Intention-­to-­treat analysis was used, and results were presented as
mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
**Results:** Among 161 randomized patients, 134 completed the study, 64 in the
intervention group and 70 in the control group. Compared with the control group
(MD 2.73; 95% CI 1.75–­3.71), patients in the intervention group (MD 4.48; 95%
CI 3.18–­5.80) had statistically significantly ( _p_ = 0.03) improved lower extremity
strength. No differences were seen for hand grip strength or muscle mass.
**Conclusion:** A home-­based PA intervention 1 year after surgery for esophageal
cancer improves lower extremity muscle strength.

## 1 | INTRODUCTION

Esophageal cancer is a debilitating disease with poor overall survival. [1] In patients selected for curatively intended
treatment, that is, mainly surgery (esophagectomy) combined with chemo(radio)therapy, the 5-­year survival is
30%–­40%. [2–­4] Esophagectomy is an extensive surgery [1] and
the neo-­adjuvant or perioperative chemo(radio)therapy
further increases patient burden. [5–­7] Most patients face
compromised physical function, [8] not the least due to loss
of muscles. [8,9] There is a great need for well-­designed trials
to prove the benefit of novel interventions that may improve physical recovery. [8] Previous studies in other cancer
types show that exercise interventions can improve physical function in patients undergoing active treatment for
cancer. [10] Although physical resistance training after the
initial recovery period following treatment for esophageal
cancer show promising results of improvement in functional capacity, there is lack of evidence on its role in long-­
term survivors. [11] There is a strong need to test if exercise
interventions can improve muscle strength and mass and
in turn physical function in long-­term survivors of esophageal cancer. This trial was designed to test the hypothesis
that home-­based exercise training in 1-­year survivors of
esophageal cancer improves their muscle mass and muscle strength.

## 2 | METHODS 2.1 | Study design and participants


The Physical Activity (PA) study was a Swedish nationwide, two-­armed, multi-­centre randomized controlled
trial (RCT) with 1:1 allocation during the study period
2016–­2020. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden
(Dnrs:2015/2142–­32; 2016/1696–­32/1; 2018/1447–­32)
[and the study was registered with Clini​calTr​ials.gov, ID:](http://clinicaltrials.gov)
NCT02774551. All procedures conducted in the study were
in line with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration
of Helsinki and its later amendments. [12] Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The
manuscript was prepared in line with CONSORT 2010
guidelines. [13]

The study participants were recruited from within the
framework of a nationwide and prospective data collection
in Sweden, The Oesophageal Surgery in Cancer patients:
Adaptation and Recovery study (OSCAR), presented
in detailed elsewhere. [14] The OSCAR study includes all
Swedish-­speaking patients with no cognitive dysfunction
who underwent curatively intended surgery for esophageal
cancer in Sweden from 2013 and onwards and included in



the cohort 1 year postoperatively, that is, from 2014 and
onwards. The patients were identified through pathology
departments at one of the seven university hospitals conducting surgery for esophageal cancer in Sweden. All patients within the OSCAR study were invited to participate
in this RCT. Eligibility criteria to be included in the RCT
were all patients in Sweden who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer in 2015–­2019 included in the
OSCAR study 1 year after surgery, that is, between 2016
and 2020. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had
physical, psychological or social conditions that prevented
participation (Figure 1). Moreover, patients with pacemakers, cochlear or other electrical implants considered
unsafe to use the bio-­impedance scale in the trial were excluded for safety reasons.

## 2.2 | Randomization


All patients were provided oral and written information
about the study at a visit by a research nurse and those
who agreed to participate provided consent. The randomization procedure (block randomization) was conducted
by an external organization outside the research group
(Karolinska Trial Alliance, KTA) to avoid selection bias by
anonymising the patient ID. Due to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to conceal the participants'
group allocation to neither patients nor researchers involved. However, the participants' allocation to intervention or control groups was masked in the dataset available
for researchers during data analysis. Half of the eligible
patients were randomized to intervention with home-­
based exercise and half to standard care (control group).

## 2.3 | Intervention versus standard care


The intervention consisted of a 12-­week, home-­based exercise training based on previous data. [15] Firstly, the research
nurse suggested 150 min weekly activity of minimum intensity (e.g., walking, swimming, cycling) to the patients.
They were as well encouraged a daily lifestyle activity
(minimum intensity PA), for example, gardening, vacuuming to contribute to the 150 min, in the absence of aerobic
activities. The research nurse introduced 5 simple strength
training exercises (Table 1) targeting the major muscle
groups with repetitions of 10 and 2 sets to do twice a week.
The exercises were modified from the Centers for disease
control and prevention, recommendations: strength training for older adults, [16] the Swedish recommendations for
PA in the Prevention and Treatment of Disease for elderly [17] and for cancer patients. [18] The exercises were modified considering the average age of the target group and

the possibility to conduct them at home. The resistance
training was progressive in nature by means of increasing
resistance in the band during the 12 weeks if acceptable
with the patients and depended on their adaptability to
the intervention. The patients tested the exercises guided
by the research nurse. Patients were also provided with a
pamphlet and/or video link demonstrating the exercises.
All patients (intervention group and control group) were
informed about the WHO recommendations of physical activities among older people (150 min weekly and
strength training 2 times weekly) and their health benefits.


## 2.4 | Compliance

The intervention group were followed up weekly by telephone by the research dietician/nurse to encourage adherence to the intervention. They were asked to report if
during the past week they had performed the exercises as
per the instructions received from the research nurse with
the alternatives: (1) Yes, completely (2) Yes, but not all exercises (3) Yes, but only once (4) No, not at all. Compliance
was assessed as “yes” (alternative 1 and 2) and as “no” (alternatives 3/4).

## 2.5 | Measurements


All measures of muscle strength and muscle mass were
assessed objectively by the research dietician/nurse during the home visit both before randomization (baseline)
and approximately 12 weeks after randomization.
Muscle strength was assessed using two separate tests,
one for hand grip strength and another for lower extremity strength. (1) Hand grip strength was measured using
a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Model SH5001 JAMAR,
SAEHAN Corporation, Changwon, S. Korea). [19] Three consecutive measures were taken on the dominant hand. (2)
Lower extremity strength was measured using a 30-­second
chair stand test, performed according to instructions from
the CDC. [20] Patients were instructed to sit in the middle of
the chair with their hands placed on the opposite shoulder
crossed, at the wrists and the feet kept flat on the floor.
Patients were told to have their back straight and have the
arms against their chest. Patients were asked to rise from
the chair on hearing the word “go,” to a full standing position, then sit back down again and repeat this for 30 s.
Simultaneously, the research nurse/dietitian started the
timer on “go” and recorded the number of times the patient came to a full standing position in 30 s. If the patient
was over halfway to a standing position when 30 s elapsed,
it was counted as a stand. Both these assessments are validated and are well-­established. [21]

Muscle mass was measured using a portable bio-­
impedance analysis monitor (TANITA SC240MA), which
measures body composition by placing the patient's feet
on electrodes that measured resistance to an electrical



signal (impedance). The technique is based on the principle that lean tissues have a high water and electrolyte
content, and thus provides a good electrical pathway. The
resistance measurement relates directly to the volume
of the conductor, which is used to determine total body
water, muscle mass (fat-­free mass) and fat mass. [22]

Changes in muscle strength were measured as the difference in absolute change in both maximal and average
hand grip strength (dynamometer) and functional lower
extremity strength (30-­second chair stand test) between
baseline and shortly (within 2 weeks) after the 12-­week intervention period. Changes in muscle mass were assessed
as the difference in absolute change in muscle mass (portable bio-­impedance analysis monitor) between baseline
and shortly (within 2 weeks) after the 12-­week intervention period.
The secondary outcomes, that is, patient reported outcomes, PA levels, and food intake were not included in the
present article.

## 2.6 | Clinical data


For all included patients, copies of relevant medical records were retrieved from the hospitals, that is, predominantly from the seven university hospitals to provide
additional clinical details about the tumor and treatment.
These records were assessed according to a detailed predefined study protocol to ensure uniformity in the data
collection.

## 2.7 | Sample size


The sample size was determined by the power calculations for the muscle strength and mass. Using one-­sided
test and alpha at 0.05, sampling ratio 1, superiority margin of 0.001, to test the superiority of the intervention, 160
patients (80 patients per group after adjusting for 5% drop-­
outs) were required for 80% power for detecting increase
in muscle strength or muscle mass in at least 25% patients
in the intervention group and ≤ 10% patients in the control
group. An increase of 3% in muscle mass represented a
minimum expected change. [23]

## 2.8 | Statistical analysis


Summary statistics for continuous variables (means and
standard deviations) and categorical variables (counts
and proportions) were presented for both the intervention
and control groups. An aggregate of the compliance for
all 12 weeks for each individual was obtained by dividing

|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|

|||||



100/12 for example, 100% compliance if patients have
full compliance for all 12 weeks, 92% if they have missed
1 week, 83% if missed 2 weeks, etc, and presented as mean.
All available data were included in the statistical analysis referring to the intention-­to-­treat approach with respect
to the original study group assignment and regardless of
the patient's participation rate in the exercise intervention.
Complete case analysis was used and no attempt to impute missing data was made. Changes in muscle strength
and muscle mass were assessed as continuous outcomes.
Mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were calculated to compare changes between baseline and
post-­intervention assessments for the two groups. Owing
to limited sample size, randomization might not be sufficient to control for confounding. Therefore, three models were used. In model 1, no confounders were adjusted
for, and independent _t_ -­tests were performed. In model 2,
adjustments were made for age (continuous), sex (male,
female), and preoperative body mass index (continuous),
which were identified as potential confounders while deciding the study protocol. In model 2, baseline PA level
was also identified as a potential confounder originally
but was dropped off in the final analysis because it correlated highly with preoperative body mass index. In the
final model 3, adjustments were made for variables for
which we observed a major difference between the comparison group in Table 2 (postoperative complications,
tumor stage, and co-­morbidities) and preoperative body
mass index because this variable was statistically significant between the intervention and control groups at baseline in model 2. The level of significance was set at _p_ ≤ 0.05.
All statistical analysis were performed by an experienced
biostatistician (AJ) who followed a pre-­defined protocol
and used the statistical software SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).

## 3 | RESULTS 3.1 | Study participants


Patient enrolment was consecutive and lasted from
January 2016 to August 2020. A total of 243 survivors from
the OSCAR study were assessed for eligibility. Of them, 233
met the inclusion criteria, but 72 declined to participate.
The remaining 161 participants (69.1% of those eligible)
were randomly assigned to either the intervention group
( _n_ = 80) or control group ( _n_ = 81). Of these patients, 28
(17% of those randomized) were lost to follow-­up (16 from
the intervention group and 12 from the control group).
Hence, 64 patients completed the study from the intervention group and all 64 were included in the final analysis

for hand grip strength and lower extremity strength and
63 for muscle mass (missing = 1). Likewise, 70 completed
the study from the control group however only 68 for hand
grip strength (missing = 2), 67 for lower extremity strength
(missing = 3) and 69 for muscle mass (missing = 1) were included in the final analysis. The progress of all participants
during the trial is shown in the flow diagram (Figure 1)
adapted from the CONSORT 2010 statement. [13]

Patient characteristics are presented in Table 2. Most
participants in both the intervention and control groups
were males and had almost the same average age at the
date of surgery. The PA levels at baseline were similar
between both groups. The main histological type in both
groups was adenocarcinoma. Most of the patients received
neo-­adjuvant therapy in both groups.
The compliance rate in the intervention group was
91%. The changes in the means between baseline and
post-­intervention, comparing the intervention with control group for all the primary outcome measures are presented as a panel graph in Figure 2.

## 3.2 | Hand grip strength

Among the 70 patients with completed measures in
the control group, two patients had missing values for
hand grip strength and hence were not included in the
final analysis (Figure 1). Both the maximal and average
hand grip strength showed a decline post-­intervention
for both the groups (Figure 2). The point estimates
suggested a more marked decline in maximal hand
grip strength for the control group (MD: −0.85; 95%
CI: −2.03 to 0.32) than the intervention group (MD:
−0.72; 95% CI: −1.86 to 0.43) as per model 1, and models 2 and 3 showed similar results (Table 3). In contrast, the point estimates indicated a worse decline in
average hand grip strength for the intervention group
(MD: −1.01; 95% CI: −2.28 to 0.26) than the control
group (MD: −0.62; 95% CI: −1.79 to 0.56) as per model
1, and models 2 and 3 showed same results (Table 3).
However, none of these MDs were statistically significant (Table 3).

## 3.3 | Lower extremity strength

From those who had completed measures in the control
group ( _n_ = 70), three patients had missing values for the
30-­second chair stand test and were excluded from this analysis (Figure 1). The changes in means between baseline and
follow-­up showed an increase in lower extremity strength
measured using the 30-­second chair stand test for both the
groups (Figure 2). The MDs between baseline and follow-­up
were 4.48 (95% CI: 3.18 to 5.80) for the intervention group and
2.73 (95% CI: 1.75 to 3.71) for the control group as per model 1
and were statistically significantly higher for the intervention
group (Table 3). These differences were statistically significantly higher for the intervention group compared with the
control group also according to model 2 and model 3 (Table 3).


## 3.4 | Muscle mass

Among the participants with complete end of study
measures in the intervention group ( _n_ = 64) and control group ( _n_ = 70), missing values were observed for
( _n_ = 1) and ( _n_ = 2) respectively and were thus not
included in the analysis for muscle mass (Figure 1).
Changes between baseline and post-­intervention
means of muscle mass showed a slight increase for
both groups (Figure 2). The control group had more
increase in muscle mass than the intervention group
in model 1 (MD: 0.14; 95% CI: −1.34 to 1.61 for the
intervention group and MD: 0.33; 95% CI: −0.83 to
1.48 for the control group), but not in models 2 or 3
(Table 3).

## 4 | DISCUSSION

This trial demonstrated that a specially designed 12-­week
home-­based PA program improved lower extremity muscle strength among patients having undergone surgery for
esophageal cancer 1-­year earlier, while no influence on
hand grip strength or muscle mass was identified.
Some methodological strengths and weaknesses of
the trial should be considered. A major strength was the
nationwide multicentered design that ensured that all eligible patients were identified yielding a high enrolment
rate. Adherence to a rigorous protocol enabled homogeneity in the recruitment process also uniformity and
completeness of the data collected. Moreover, a comprehensive variable list with patient and clinical data allowed
for adjustment for predefined confounders and variables
observed to vary between intervention and control groups
at baseline. Another notable strength is the unique home-­
visit design for data collection by the research nurse at
baseline and research dietician at follow-­up, which aided
increased completeness and reduced missing values at
both time points. One potential limitation may have been
the exclusion of patients not willing to start a PA intervention may present a potential for selection bias. In addition, a slightly higher attrition rate in the intervention
group than the control group also may have contributed to
some extent of selection bias. Another limitation is that although preoperative BMI was adjusted for in the analysis,
unknown confounders such as pre-­operative muscle mass
and distribution of body fat among patients may have still
differed between the groups but unaccounted for in the
analysis but the RCT design may help reduce these imbalances. In addition, the higher drop-­out rate (17% of those
randomized) than assumed in the original sample size calculated is another limitation in the present study.
To our knowledge, this is the first RCT to examine the
effectiveness of a home-­based PA intervention in long-­
term survivors of esophageal cancer. The results cannot
be directly compared to other exercise trials among post-­
operative esophageal cancer survivors since they were not
conducted at the same time point after surgery. In other
studies testing exercise interventions after esophageal cancer surgery, the intervention was either multidimensional
including both PA and nutritional components or conducted immediately after surgery. [24–­26] The present study
included a unidimensional intervention of only PA and
recruited patients at 1-­year following surgery. This time
point was selected because the patients are usually sufficiently recovered to have the motivation and strength to
participate in the trial. The main finding was an improvement in lower extremity muscle strength or strength of leg
muscles (quadriceps muscle group) in the intervention
group. Since the chair stand test requires both strength



and endurance, this test is a qualified and convenient
measure of strength in general. [21] On the other hand, the
study did not reveal any consistent improvement in favor
of the intervention group in hand grip strength more than
a non-­significant trend favoring the intervention group in
relation to maximal grip strength. This may be explained
by an only moderate correlation of grip strength with
strength in other body compartments. [21] The resistance
training performed in this study aimed at strengthening
the major body muscles, including the leg muscles, and
had less focus on arm muscles. The results from our study
also did not favor an increase in muscle mass in the intervention as measured by BIA, which was chosen considering the convenience of its portability and its suitability
to the design of the trial. [21] However, these results might
have been biased because BIA does not measure muscle
mass directly, but instead derives an estimate of muscle
mass based on whole-­body electrical conductivity. [27–­30] In
addition, BIA measurements can be influenced by hydration status of the patient. [29,31] A validation of the portable
bio-­impedance analysis monitor (TANITA SC240MA)
used in this RCT compared with computer-­tomography
scans from patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers is
underway and expected to throw more light on the potential for measurement bias. It is also unclear if the intensity
of the exercises and their progression as well as duration
of the program were optimal to identify a difference in
arm muscle strength and muscle mass. Another consideration is that the control group received no comparison
treatment and were not blinded to the intervention. This
might have led patients to test the intervention or an alternate intervention with the thought that the intervention
is beneficial.
A distinctive strength of our trial was the home-­based
exercise intervention, that was designed to personalize the
intervention according to patient specific considerations
such as their average age, invasive treatment history and
a nationwide recruitment. The intervention was designed
to be simple, safe, easy to perform, monitored from distance, and inexpensive. Home-­based exercise programs
show promising potential for effective improvement of
symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life in patients
with lung, [32–­34] breast, [35,36] colorectal, [37–­39] and prostate cancer. [40,41] Patients express strong preference for home-­based
exercises in oncology settings owing to removed costs and
travel to an exercise facility, and the flexibility to accommodate competing commitments. [42–­44] Patients' preference
towards participating in home-­based exercise programs
are mainly owing to the ability to self-­manage, feeling
comfortable exercising without qualified supervision,
and a desire for autonomy. [43,44] Although prehabilitation
and rehabilitation have gained significant attention since
their incorporation in the enhanced recovery programs

in patients being treated for esophageal cancer, studies
testing the effectiveness of home-­based interventions are
lacking. Ours is the first trial to test a tailored home-­based
intervention program in esophageal cancer survivors, a
patient group with high requirements for rehabilitation
after having undergone one of the most invasive surgical
treatments known for cancer.
The long and incomplete recovery with substantial
limitations in long-­term recovery in postoperative survivors of esophageal cancer is a concern for patients, healthcare, and society. Most patients need many follow-­up
appointments with healthcare during several years, and
the limited availability of interventions that can help these
patients is a great concern. Thus, the focus on the role of
a physical training program after surgery for esophageal
cancer in improving muscle strength, which is a major determinant of physical recovery, is imperative. The results
of this trial, testing the intervention of a tailored 12-­week
home-­based PA program contribute to the development
in the post-­operative management of these patients. The
results show promising potential for encouraging patients
to be physically active after surgery and in turn enhance
the rehabilitation and provide a novel and robust tool for
better recovery. An improved recovery would decrease the
burden on healthcare by increasing patient self-­care and
reducing the need for further or extra appointments. A research partnership group consisting of patients operated
on for esophageal cancer were presented with the results
of the present study and inputs from their interpretation
of the results are included in the discussion above.
In conclusion, this nationwide multicenter RCT
demonstrated that a tailored home-­based PA intervention
induced improvement in lower extremity muscle strength
among esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgery for esophageal cancer 1-­year earlier. Although
further investigations are warranted to determine the optimum intensity of the intervention and potential measurement bias, the results should be enough for encouraging
patients to be physically active after surgery in the longer
term to improve the recovery.
