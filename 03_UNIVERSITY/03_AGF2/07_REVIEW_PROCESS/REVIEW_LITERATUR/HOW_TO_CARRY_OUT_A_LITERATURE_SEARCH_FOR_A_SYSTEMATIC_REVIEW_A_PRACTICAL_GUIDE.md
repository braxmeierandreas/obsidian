# How to carry out a literature search for a systematic review: a practical guide

Lauren Z. Atkinson & Andrea Cipriani



SUMMARY

Performing an effective literature search to obtain
the best available evidence is the basis of any evidence-based discipline, in particular evidencebased medicine. However, with a vast and growing
volume of published research available, searching
the literature can be challenging. Even when journals are indexed in electronic databases, it can be
difficult to identify all relevant studies without an
effective search strategy. It is also important to
search unpublished literature to reduce publication bias, which occurs from a tendency for
authors and journals to preferentially publish statistically significant studies. This article is intended
for clinicians and researchers who are approaching the field of evidence synthesis and would like
to perform a literature search. It aims to provide
advice on how to develop the search protocol
and the strategy to identify the most relevant evidence for a given research or clinical question. It
will also focus on how to search not only the published but also the unpublished literature using a
number of online resources.


LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 - Understand the purpose of conducting a literature search and its integral part of the literature review process

 - Become aware of the range of sources that are
available, including electronic databases of
published data and trial registries to identify
unpublished data

 - Understand how to develop a search strategy
and apply appropriate search terms to interrogate electronic databases or trial registries

A literature search is distinguished from, but integral to, a literature review. Literature reviews are
conducted for the purpose of (a) locating information on a topic or identifying gaps in the literature
for areas of future study, (b) synthesising conclusions in an area of ambiguity and (c) helping



clinicians and researchers inform decision-making
and practice guidelines. Literature reviews can be
narrative or systematic, with narrative reviews
aiming to provide a descriptive overview of selected
literature, without undertaking a systematic literature search. By contrast, systematic reviews use
explicit and replicable methods in order to retrieve
all available literature pertaining to a specific topic
to answer a defined question (Higgins 2011).
Systematic reviews therefore require a priori strategies to search the literature, with predefined criteria
for included and excluded studies that should be
reported in full detail in a review protocol.
Performing an effective literature search to obtain
the best available evidence is the basis of any evidence-based discipline, in particular evidence-based
medicine (Sackett 1997; McKeever 2015). However,
with a vast and growing volume of published research
available, searching the literature can be challenging.
Even when journals are indexed in electronic
databases, it can be difficult to identify all relevant
studies without an effective search strategy
(Hopewell 2007). In addition, unpublished data and
‘grey’ literature (informally published material such
as conference abstracts) are now becoming more
accessible to the public. It is important to search
unpublished literature to reduce publication bias,
which occurs because of a tendency for authors and
journals to preferentially publish statistically significantstudies(Dickersin 1993).Effortstolocateunpublished and grey literature during the search process
can help to reduce bias in the results of systematic
reviews (Song 2010). A paradigmatic example demonstrating the importance of capturing unpublished
data is that of Turner et al (2008), who showed that
using only published data in their meta-analysis led
to effect sizes for antidepressants that were one-third
(32%) larger than effect sizes derived from combining
both published and unpublished data. Such differences in findings from published and unpublished
data can have real-life implications in clinical decision-making and treatment recommendation. In
another relevant publication, Whittington et al
(2004) compared the risks and benefits of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) inthe treatment

of depression in children. They found that published
data suggested favourable risk–benefit profiles for
SSRIs in this population, but the addition of unpublished data indicated that risk outweighed treatment
benefits. The relative weight of drug efficacy to sideeffects can be skewed if there has been a failure to
search for, or include, unpublished data.
In this guide for clinicians and researchers on how
to perform a literature search we use a working
example about efficacy of an intervention for
bipolar disorder to demonstrate the search techniques outlined. However, the overarching methods
described are purposefully broad to make them
accessible to all clinicians and researchers, regardless of their research or clinical question.


Defining the clinical question


The review question will guide not only the search
strategy, but also the conclusions that can be
drawn from the review, as these will depend on
which studies or other forms of evidence are included
and excluded from the literature review. A narrow
question will produce a narrow and precise search,
perhaps resulting in too few studies on which to
base a review, or be so focused that the results are
not useful in wider clinical settings. Using an overly
narrow search also increases the chances of missing
important studies. A broad question may produce
an imprecise search, with many false-positive
search results. These search results may be too heterogeneous to evaluate in one review. Therefore
from the outset, choices should be made about the
remit of the review, which will in turn affect the
search.
A number of frameworks can be used to break the
review question into concepts. One such is the PICO
(population, intervention, comparator and outcome)
framework, developed to answer clinical questions
such as the effectiveness of a clinical intervention
(Richardson 1995). It is noteworthy that ‘outcome’
concepts of the PICO framework are less often used
in a search strategy as they are less well defined in
the titles and abstracts of available literature
(Higgins 2011). Although PICO is widely used, it is
not a suitable framework for identifying key elements
of all questions in the medical field, and minor adaptations are necessary to enable the structuring of different questions. Other frameworks exist that may be
more appropriate for questions about health policy
and management, such as ECLIPSE (expectation,
client group, location, impact, professionals,
service) (Wildridge 2002) or SPICE (setting, perspective, intervention, comparison, evaluation) for
service evaluation (Booth 2006). A detailed overview
of frameworks is provided in Davies (2011).



How to carry out a literature search for a systematic review


Scoping search


Before conducting a comprehensive literature search,
a scoping search of the literature using just one or
two databases (such as PubMed or MEDLINE) can
provide valuable information as to how much literature for a given review question already exists. A
scoping search may reveal whether systematic
reviews have already been undertaken for a review
question. Caution should be taken, however, as systematic reviews that may appear to ask the same
question may have differing inclusion and exclusion
criteria for studies included in the review. In addition, not all systematic reviews are of the same
quality. If the original search strategy is of poor
quality methodologically, original data are likely to
have been missed and the search should not simply
be updated (compare, for example, Naughton et al
(2014) and Caddy et al (2015) on ketamine for treatment-resistant depression).


Search strategy


The first step in conducting a literature search
should be to develop a search strategy. The search
strategy should define how relevant literature will
be identified. It should identify sources to be
searched (list of databases and trial registries) and
keywords used in the literature (list of keywords).
The search strategy should be documented as an
integral part of the systematic review protocol. Just
as the rest of a well-conducted systematic review,
the search strategy used needs to be explicit and
detailed such that it could reproduced using the
same methodology, with exactly the same results,
or updated at a later time. This not only improves
the reliability and accuracy of the review, but also
means that if the review is replicated, the difference
in reviewers should have little effect, as they will use
an identical search strategy. The PRISMA
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses) statement was developed to
standardise the reporting of systematic reviews
(Moher 2009). The PRISMA statement consists of
a 27-item checklist to assess the quality of each
element of a systematic review (items 6, 7 and 8
relate to the quality of literature searching) and
also to guide authors when reporting their findings.


Sources to search


There are a number of databases that can be
searched for literature, but the identification of relevant sources is dependent on the clinical or research
question (different databases have different focuses,
from more biology to more social science oriented)
and the type of evidence that is sought (i.e. some
databases report only randomised controlled trials).

Atkinson & Cipriani










- MEDLINE and Embase are the two main biomedical literature databases. MEDLINE contains
more than 22 million references from more
than 5600 journals worldwide. In addition, the
MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations database holds references before they
are published on MEDLINE. Embase has a
strong coverage of drug and pharmaceutical
research and provides over 30 million references
from more than 8500 currently published journals, 2900 of which are not in MEDLINE.
These two databases, however, are only available
to either individual subscribers or through institutional access such as universities and hospitals.
PubMed, developed by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information of the US National
Library of Medicine, provides access to a free
version of MEDLINE and is accessible to
researchers, clinicians and the public. PubMed
comprises medical and biomedical literature
indexed in MEDLINE, but provides additional
access to life science journals and e-books.


In addition, there are a number of subject- and discipline-specific databases.




- PsycINFO covers a range of psychological,
behavioural, social and health sciences research.

- The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL) hosts the most comprehensive source of randomised and quasi-randomised
controlled trials. Although some of the evidence
on this register is also included in Embase and
MEDLINE, there are over 150 000 reports
indexed from other sources, such as conference
proceedings and trial registers, that would otherwise be less accessible (Dickersin 2002).

- The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
Health Literature (CINAHL), British Nursing
Index (BNI) and the British Nursing Database
(formerly BNI with Full Text) are databases relevant to nursing, but they span literature across
medical, allied health, community and health management journals.

- The Allied and Complementary Medicine
Database (AMED) is a database specifically for
alternative treatments in medicine.


The examples of specific databases given here are
by no means exhaustive, but they are popular and
likely to be used for literature searching in medicine,
psychiatry and psychology. Website links for these
databases are given in Box 1, along with links to
resources not mentioned above. Box 1 also provides
a website link to a couple of video tutorials for
searching electronic databases. Box 2 shows an
example of the search sources chosen for a review
of a pharmacological intervention of calcium
channel antagonists in bipolar disorder, taken
from a recent systematic review (Cipriani 2016a).
For a comprehensive search of the literature it has
been suggested that two or more electronic databases should be used (Suarez-Almazor 2000).
Suarez-Almazor and colleagues demonstrated that,
in a search for controlled clinical trials (CCTs)
for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis and lower
back pain, only 67% of available citations were
found by both Embase and MEDLINE. Searching
MEDLINE alone would have resulted in 25% of
available CCTs being missed and searching
Embase alone would have resulted in 15% of CCTs
being missed. However, a balance between the sensitivity of a search (an attempt to retrieve all relevant
literature in an extensive search) and the specificity
of a search (an attempt to retrieve a more manageable number of relevant citations) is optimal.
In addition, supplementing electronic database
searches with unpublished literature searches (see
‘Obtaining unpublished literature’ below) is likely
to reduce publication bias. The capacity of the individuals or review team is likely largely to determine
the number of sources searched. In all cases, a clear
rationale should be outlined in the review protocol



76 BJPsych Advances (2018), vol. 24, 74–82 doi: 10.1192/bja.2017.3

[https://doi.org/10.1192/bja.2017.3 Published online by Cambridge University Press](https://doi.org/10.1192/bja.2017.3)


for the sources chosen (the expertise of an information scientist is valuable in this process).


Developing a search strategy


Important methodological considerations (such as
study design) may also be included in the search
strategy. Dependent on the databases and supplementary sources chosen, filters can be used to
search the literature by study design (see
‘Searching electronic databases’). For instance, if
the search strategy is confined to one study design
term only (e.g. randomised controlled trial, RCT),
only the articles labelled in this way will be selected.
However, it is possible that in the database some
RCTs are not labelled as such, so they will not be
picked up by the filtered search. Filters can help
reduce the number of references retrieved by the
search, but using just one term is not 100% sensitive,
especially if only one database is used (i.e.
MEDLINE). It is important for systematic reviewers
to know how reliable such a strategy can be and treat
the results with caution.


Searching electronic databases


Identifying search terms


Standardised search terms are thesaurus and indexing terms that are used by electronic databases as a
convenient way to categorise articles, allowing for
efficient searching. Individual database records
may be assigned several different standardised
search terms that describe the same or similar concepts (e.g. bipolar disorder, bipolar depression,
manic–depressive psychosis, mania). This has the
advantage that even if the original article did not
use the standardised term, when the article is catalogued in a database it is allocated that term (Guaiana
2010). For example, an older paper might refer to
‘manic depression’, but would be categorised
under the term ‘bipolar disorder’ when catalogued
in MEDLINE. These standardised search terms
are called MeSH (medical subject headings) in
MEDLINE and PubMed, and Emtree in Embase,



How to carry out a literature search for a systematic review


and are organised in a hierarchal structure (Fig. 1).
In both MEDLINE and Embase an ‘explode’
command enables the database to search for a
requested term, as well as specific related terms.
Both narrow and broader search terms can be
viewed and selected to be included in the search if
appropriate to a topic. The Yale MeSH Analyzer
[tool (mesh.med.yale.edu) can be used to help iden-](http://mesh.med.yale.edu)
tify potential terms and phrases to include in a
search. It is also useful to understand why relevant
articles may be missing from an initial search, as it
produces a comparison grid of MeSH terms used
to index each article (see Box 1 for a tutorial video
link).
In addition, MEDLINE also distinguishes between
MeSH headings (MH) and publication type (PT)
terms. Publication terms are less about the content
of an article than about its type, specifying for
example a review article, meta-analysis or RCT.

Atkinson & Cipriani



Both MeSH and Emtree have their own peculiarities, with variations in thesaurus and indexing
terms. In addition, not all concepts are assigned
standardised search terms, and not all databases
use this method of indexing the literature. It is advisable to check the guidelines of selected databases
before undertaking a search. In the absence of a
MeSH heading for a particular term, free-text
terms could be used.
Free-text terms are used in natural language
and are not part of a database’s controlled vocabulary. Free-text terms can be used in addition to
standardised search terms in order to identify as
many relevant records as possible (Higgins 2011).
Using free-text terms allows the reviewer to search
using variations in language or spelling (e.g. hypomani* or mania* or manic* – see truncation and
wildcard functions below and Fig. 2). A disadvantage of free-text terms is that they are only searched
for in the title and abstracts of database records, and
not in the full texts, meaning that when a free-text
word is used only in the body of an article, it will
not be retrieved in the search. Additionally, a
number of specific considerations should be taken


Database: Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1946 to June Week 2 2016>

Search Strategy:


Population search:



into account when selecting and using free-text
terms:


- synonyms, related terms and alternative phrases
(e.g. mood instability, affective instability, mood
lability or emotion dysregulation)

- abbreviations or acronyms in medical and scientific research (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging
or MRI)

- lay and medical terminology (e.g. high blood
pressure or hypertension)

- brand and generic drug names (e.g. Prozac or
fluoxetine)

- variants in spelling (e.g. UK English and
American English: behaviour or behavior; paediatric or pediatric).


Truncation and wildcard functions can be used in
most databases to capture variations in language:


- truncation allows the stem of a word that may
have variant endings to be searched: for
example, a search for depress* uses truncation
to retrieve articles that mention both depression

and depressive; truncation symbols may vary by
database, but common symbols include: *, ! and #

- wild cards substitute one letter within a word to
retrieve alternative spellings: for example,
‘wom?n’ would retrieve the terms ‘woman’ and
‘women’.


Combining search terms


Search terms should be combined in the search strategy using Boolean operators. Boolean operators
allow standardised search terms and free-text
terms to be combined. There are three main
Boolean operators – AND, OR and NOT (Fig. 3).


- OR – this operator is used to broaden a search,
finding articles that contain at least one of the
search terms within a concept. Sets of terms can
be created for each concept, for example the
population of interest: (bipolar disorder OR
bipolar depression). Parentheses are used to
build up search terms, with words within parentheses treated as a unit.

- AND – this can be used to join sets of concepts
together, narrowing the retrieved literature to articlesthatcontainallconcepts,forexamplethepopulation or condition of interest and the intervention
to be evaluated: (bipolar disorder OR bipolar
depression) AND calcium channel blockers.
However, if at least one term from each set of concepts is not identified from the title or abstract of an
article, this article will not be identified by the
search strategy. It is worth mentioning here that
some databases can run the search also across the
full texts. For example, ScienceDirect and most
publishing houses allow this kind of search,
which is much more comprehensive than abstract
or title searches only.

- NOT – this operator, used less often, can focus a
search strategy so that it does not retrieve specific
literature, for example human studies NOT
animal studies. However, in certain cases the
NOT operator can be too restrictive, for
example if excluding male gender from a population, using ‘NOT male’ would also mean that any



How to carry out a literature search for a systematic review


articles about both males and females are not
obtained by the search.


The conventions of each database should be
checked before undertaking a literature search, as
functions and operators may differ slightly between
them (Cipriani 2016b). This is particularly relevant
when using limits and filters. Figure 2 shows an
example search strategy incorporating many of the
concepts described above. The search strategy is
taken from Cipriani et al (2016a), but simplified to
include only one intervention.


Search filters


A number of filters exist to focus a search, including
language, date and study design or study focus
filters. Language filters can restrict retrieval of articles to the English language, although if language
is not an inclusion criterion it should not be
restricted, to avoid language bias. Date filters can
be used to restrict the search to literature from a specified period, for example if an intervention was only
made available after a certain date. In addition, if
good systematic reviews exist that are likely to
capture all relevant literature (as advised by an
information specialist), date restrictions can be
used to search additional literature published after
the date of that included in the systematic review.
In the same way, date filters can be used to update
a literature search since the last time it was conducted. Reviewing the literature should be a timely
process (new and potentially relevant evidence is
produced constantly) and updating the search is an
important step, especially if collecting evidence to
inform clinical decision-making, as publications in
the field of medicine are increasing at an impressive
rate (Barber 2016). The filters chosen will depend on
the research question and nature of evidence that is
sought through the literature search and the guidelines of the individual database that is used.

Supplementary search techniques


Google Scholar


Google Scholar allows basic Boolean operators to be
used in strings of search terms. However, the search
engine does not use standardised search terms that
have been tagged as in traditional databases and
therefore variations of keywords should always
be searched. There are advantages and disadvantages
to using a web search engine such as Google Scholar.
Google Scholar searches the full text of an article
for keywords and also searches a wider range of
sources, such as conference proceedings and books,
that are not found in traditional databases, making
it a good resource to search for grey literature
(Haddaway 2015). In addition, Google Scholar finds
articles cited by other relevant articles produced in
the search. However, variable retrieval of content
(due to regular updating of Google algorithms and
the individual’s search history and location) means
that search results are not necessarily reproducible
and are therefore not in keeping with replicable
search methods required by systematic reviews.
Google Scholar alone has not been shown to retrieve
more literature than other traditional databases discussed in this article and therefore should be used in
addition to other sources (Bramer 2016).


Citation searching


Once the search strategy has identified relevant literature, the reference lists in these sources can be
searched. This is called citation searching or backward searching, and it can be used to see where particular research topics led others. This method is
particularly useful if the search identifies systematic
reviews or meta-analyses of a similar topic.


Obtaining unpublished literature


Conference abstracts


Conference abstracts are considered ‘grey literature’,
i.e. literature that is not formally published in journals or books (Alberani 1990). Scherer and colleagues found that only 52.6% of all conference
abstracts go on to full publication of results, and
factors associated with publication were studies
that had RCT designs and the reporting of positive
or significant results (Scherer 2007). Therefore,
failure to search relevant grey literature might miss
certain data and bias the results of a review.
Although conference abstracts are not indexed in
most major electronic databases, they are available
in databases such as BIOSIS Previews (Box 1).
However, as with many unpublished studies, these
data did not undergo the peer review process that
is often a tool for assessing and possibly improving
the quality of the publication.



Searching trial registers and pharmaceutical
websites


For reviews of trial interventions, a number of trial
[registers exist. ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov)](http://clinicaltrials.gov)
provides access to information on public and privately
conducted clinical trials in humans. Results for both
published and unpublished studies can be found for
many trials on the register, in addition to information
about studies that are ongoing. Searching each trial
register requires a slightly different search strategy,
but many of the basic principles described above still
apply. Basic searches on ClinicialTrials.gov include
searching by condition, specific drugs or interventions
and these can be linked using Boolean operators: for
example, (bipolar disorder OR manic depressive disorder) AND lithium. As mentioned above, parentheses
can be used to build up search terms. More advanced
searches allow one to specify further search fields such
as the status of studies, study type and age of participants. The US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) hosts a database providing information about
FDA-approved drugs, therapeutic products and
[devices (www.fda.gov). The database (with open](http://www.fda.gov)
access to anyone, not only in the USA) can be searched
by the drug name, its active ingredient or its approval
application number and, for most drugs approved in
the past 20 years or so, a review of clinical trial
results (some of which remain unpublished) used as
evidence in the approval process is available. The
European Medicines Agency (EMA) hosts a similar
register for medicines developed for use in the
[European Union (www.ema.europa.eu). An internet](http://www.ema.europa.eu)
search will show that many other national and international trial registers exist that, depending on the
review question, may be relevant search sources.
The World Health Organization International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP;
[www.who.int/ictrp) provides access to a central data-](http://www.who.int/ictrp)
base bringing a number of these national and international trial registers together. It can be searched in
much the same way as ClinicalTrials.gov.
A number of pharmaceutical companies now
share data from company-sponsored clinical trials.
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is transparent in the
sharing of its data from clinical studies and hosts
[its own clinical study register (www.gsk-clinicalstu-](http://www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com)
[dyregister.com). Eli-Lilly provides clinical trial](http://www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com)
[results both on its website (www.lillytrialguide.](http://www.lillytrialguide.com)
[com) and in external registries. However, other](http://www.lillytrialguide.com)
pharmaceutical companies, such as Wyeth and
Roche, divert users to clinical trial results in external
registries. These registries include both published
and previously unpublished studies. Searching techniques differ for each company and hand-searching
through documents is often required to identify

How to carry out a literature search for a systematic review



Communication with authors


Direct communication with authors of published
papers could produce both additional data omitted
from published studies and other unpublished
studies. Contact details are usually available for
the corresponding author of each paper. Although
high-quality reviews do make efforts to obtain and
include unpublished data, this does have potential
disadvantages: the data may be incomplete and are
likely not to have been peer-reviewed. It is also
important to note that, although reviewers should
make every effort to find unpublished data in an
effort to minimise publication bias, there is still
likely to remain a degree of this bias in the studies
selected for a systematic review.


Conclusions


Developing a literature search strategy is a key part
of the systematic review process, and the conclusions
reached in a systematic review will depend on the
quality of the evidence retrieved by the literature
search. Sources should therefore be selected to minimise the possibility of bias, and supplementary
search techniques should be used in addition to electronic database searching to ensure that an extensive review of the literature has been carried out. It
is worth reminding that developing a search strategy
should be an iterative and flexible process (Higgins
2011), and only by conducting a search oneself
will one learn about the vast literature available
and how best to capture it.

MCQs
Select the single best option for each question stem


1 A systematic literature review is:
a an explicit and replicable method used to retrieve
all available literature pertaining to a specific
topic to answer a defined question
b a descriptive overview of selected literature
c an initial impression of a topic which is understood more fully as a research study is conducted
d a method of gathering opinions of all clinicians or
researchers in a given field
e a step-by-step process of identifying the earliest
published literature through to the latest published literature.



2 A search protocol:
a does not need to be specified in advance of a
literature search
b does not need to be reported in a systematic
literature review
c defines which sources of literature are to be
searched, but not how a search is to be carried
out
d defines how relevant literature will be identified
and provides a basis for the search strategy
e provides a timeline for searching each electronic
database or unpublished literature source.


3 To identify studies from a topic in general
medicine, it would be most appropriate to
search:
a the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL)
b MEDLINE
c PsycINFO
d the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
Health Literature (CINAHL)
e the British Nursing Index.



4 Literature about available treatments for
bipolar disorder would be retrieved using
the search terms:
a bipolar disorder OR treatment
b bipolar* OR treatment
c bipolar disorder AND treatment
d bipolar disorder NOT treatment
e (bipolar disorder) OR (treatment).


5 Supplementing electronic database
searches with unpublished literature
searches is likely to reduce the possibility
that a systematic review will have:
a publication bias
b funding bias
c language bias
d outcome reporting bias
e selection bias.
