# Breaking Boundaries: How Immersive Virtual Reality Is Reshaping Nursing Education.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is sparking significant interest among nursing educators as a new method of simulation in clinical education. IVR maximizes the power of presence, which stimulates senses, creating a feeling of being situated in the given virtual environment more than in the physical environment, providing more realistic learning experiences for students to practice clinical decision-making and clinical judgment skills. This multi-site descriptive study sought to develop and integrate five IVR scenarios (IVRSs) in a prelicensure senior-level baccalaureate course and to investigate students' perceptions of cognitive workload, usability, and learning while using IVR. Five IVRSs were developed and integrated, accompanied by a step-by-step guide for implementing IVRSs. Students were scheduled in five 2-hour sessions to independently complete each IVRS followed by a reflective debriefing led by a trained debriefer.
