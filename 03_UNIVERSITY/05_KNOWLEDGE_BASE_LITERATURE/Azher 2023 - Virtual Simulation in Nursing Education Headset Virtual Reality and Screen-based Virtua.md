# Virtual Simulation in Nursing Education: Headset Virtual Reality and Screen-based Virtual Simulation Offer A Comparable Experience.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • Screen- and headset-based virtual simulation modalities yield similar performance. • Screen- and headset-based virtual simulation modalities have comparable usability. • Screen- and headset-based virtual simulation modalities require similar mental load. • Screen- and headset-based virtual simulation modalities foster similar emotions. Simulations have become widely used in health care education to enhance learner preparedness. Virtual simulations, both screen- or headset-based, provide nursing students with the ability and flexibility to practice patient care at their convenience and obtain valuable automatic feedback before treating patients. While cheaper than in-person simulations and effective in teaching students, limited work exists to provide guidance concerning which modality type (screen-based or headset) offers an optimal interactive learning experience. We compared nursing students' (n = 29) performance (Oxford Medical Simulation software-generated score), ratings of usa
