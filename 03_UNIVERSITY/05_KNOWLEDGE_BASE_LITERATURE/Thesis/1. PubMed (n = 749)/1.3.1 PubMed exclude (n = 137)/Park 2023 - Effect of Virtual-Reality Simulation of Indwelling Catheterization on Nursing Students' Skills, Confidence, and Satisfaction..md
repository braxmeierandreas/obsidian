# Effect of Virtual-Reality Simulation of Indwelling Catheterization on Nursing Students' Skills, Confidence, and Satisfaction.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • VR training improves students' skills in performing indwelling catheterization. • VR training improves students' confidence in performing indwelling catheterization. • VR training fosters higher learning satisfaction. Three-dimensional virtual-reality (VR) simulation is an innovative nursing education method widely used to provide practical education. Indwelling catheterization is a nursing technique that requires complex skills and is time-consuming. This quasi-experimental study investigated the effect of VR practice in a simulated hospital environment compared as the control group practiced using mannequins in an open laboratory. A total of 44 sophomore nursing students participated in this study. Both groups showed increased skills in performing indwelling catheterization. The confidence in the experimental group showed a more significant increase. The experimental group also showed significantly higher satisfaction scores. Nursing students showed improvement in skills and a sig
