# Enhancing nursing competence and knowledge: Evaluating the impact of immersive virtual reality in nursing education.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is emerging as an innovative simulation method, offering a controlled environment to demonstrate competencies. However, there remains a gap in evidence regarding its impact on outcomes. Little is known regarding how IVR can be used in clinical education, highlighting the need for research to inform regulatory guidance. The aim of the present study was to test the impact of newly developed multipatient IVR scenarios on baccalaureate, senior nursing students' knowledge and clinical competence. Five multipatient IVR scenarios were co-developed and integrated into a senior-level course at three sites. Participants completed each scenario using the Meta Quest 2 virtual reality headset and then participated in a reflective debriefing. Participants completed the Multipatient Knowledge Assessment Scale (MKAS) before the scenario and after the debriefing. The data analytics were aligned with four subscales of the Creighton Competency Evaluation Instrument-Clinic
