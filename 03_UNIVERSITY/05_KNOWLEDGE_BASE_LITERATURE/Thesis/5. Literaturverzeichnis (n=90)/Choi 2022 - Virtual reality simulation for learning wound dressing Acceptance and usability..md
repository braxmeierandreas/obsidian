# Virtual reality simulation for learning wound dressing: Acceptance and usability.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> Using virtual reality (VR) for clinical training is a promising pedagogical approach. This study evaluated virtual wound dressing simulators developed for learning the basic skills. A desktop simulator (DTS) and an immersive simulator (IMS) were evaluated by 30 nursing students. Knowledge test (KT), user acceptance questionnaire (UAQ) and system usability questionnaire (SUQ) were administered after using the simulators. The mean KT scores for DTS and IMS were similar. The mean UAQ and SUQ scores for IMS were relatively higher. Positive feedback was obtained, with IMS favored for higher level of realism and DTS for being more convenient to use. Both simulators can promote engaging learning experience and facilitate wound dressing training.
