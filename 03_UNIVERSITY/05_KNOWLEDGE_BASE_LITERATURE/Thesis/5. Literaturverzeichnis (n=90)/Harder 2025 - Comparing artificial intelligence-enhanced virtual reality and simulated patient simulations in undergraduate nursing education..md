# Comparing artificial intelligence-enhanced virtual reality and simulated patient simulations in undergraduate nursing education.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • AI-VR uniquely supports psychological safety, iterative learning, and confidence-building, in communication. • SP simulation remains essential for emotional realism and nuanced interpersonal interactions. • This paper provides empirical support for integrated simulation strategies, advancing the conversation on how to effectively combine emerging and traditional modalities in nursing curricula. Simulation-based learning (SBL) is foundational in nursing education, traditionally employing simulated patients (SPs) to create realistic clinical scenarios. Recent technological advances have introduced Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Virtual Reality (AI-VR) as a scalable, cost-effective alternative. This qualitative descriptive study explored undergraduate nursing students' experiences with both AI-VR and SP simulations, focusing on perceptions of realism, psychological safety, and skill development. While 240 students participated overall (120 in each simulation modality), in-depth quali
