# Effectiveness of integrating generative artificial intelligence with virtual reality for maternity communication simulation: A randomized controlled trial.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • NLP-VRCS integrating ChatGPT-based NLP and VR was developed to enhance communication training. • Integrating generative AI enabled dynamic, personalized communication practice with real-time feedback. • Students reported improvements in empathy, communication confidence, and communication skills. • NLP-VRCS provided a safe, immersive learning environment that enhanced clinical readiness. • The system supported the practical application of communication skills in clinical training. Communication and empathy are equally vital in maternity nursing. However, nursing students often encounter difficulties in clinical communication due to a lack of communication skills training. A Natural Language Processing Virtual Reality Communication Simulation (NLP-VRCS) was developed by integrating ChatGPT-based generative artificial intelligence (AI) with virtual reality to assist communication skills training. The empathy, communication confidence, and skills of nursing students trained using the N
