# Comparing the effectiveness of immersive virtual simulation and high-fidelity simulations in mechanical ventilator nursing education: A randomized crossover design.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • Immersive virtual simulation (IVS) and high-fidelity simulation (HFS) training for mechanical ventilator nursing education are equally effective in improving knowledge. • IVS is more effective than HFS training in improving nursing practice confidence, learning engagement, and learning satisfaction and self-confidence. • Overall, learning needs were met to a similar or higher degree in IVS learning environments compared to traditional clinical practice or face-to-face simulation learning environments. Virtual platforms offer an effective solution to replace or complement traditional training methods by facilitating flexible learning focused on knowledge and nursing practice. A randomized, crossover design study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of immersive virtual simulation (IVS) and high-fidelity simulation (HFS) in mechanical ventilator nursing education. Thirty-two fourth-year nursing students in South Korea were randomly assigned to the Sequence 1 (IVS followed by HFS
