# The virtual reality embedded instructor: Transforming nursing education one innovation at a time.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • VRS creates immersive clinical environments, honing critical thinking without risks. • The VRS Embedded Instructor Model integrates faculty directly in virtual spaces. • Embedded instructors provide real-time feedback at critical decision points. • Results show improved clinical confidence and patient care readiness. • Learners strongly endorsed having instructors in VR for guidance and support. Virtual reality simulations (VRS) in nursing education typically promote independent learning with limited faculty involvement. This study investigated how embedding clinical instructors within VR environments influences nursing learners' experiences. This descriptive qualitative study implemented a novel Virtual Reality Simulation Embedded Instructor Model with junior nursing students (n = 213) across two semesters. Learners participated in a chest pain emergency department simulation with instructors present virtually. Data collection utilized the validated Simulation Effectiveness Tool-Mo
