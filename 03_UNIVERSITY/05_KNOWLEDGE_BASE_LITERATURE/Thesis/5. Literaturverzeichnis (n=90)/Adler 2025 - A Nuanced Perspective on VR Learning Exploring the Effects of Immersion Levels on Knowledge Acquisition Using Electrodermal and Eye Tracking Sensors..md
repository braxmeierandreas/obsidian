# A Nuanced Perspective on VR Learning: Exploring the Effects of Immersion Levels on Knowledge Acquisition Using Electrodermal and Eye Tracking Sensors.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> Background: This study investigates the effect of immersion levels in virtual reality (VR) learning environments on the acquisition of declarative and procedural knowledge. Prior research indicates that immersion affects cognitive load, but its impact on declarative and procedural knowledge outcomes remains unclear. This study utilises a multimodal approach, combining self‐reports with data from psychophysiological sensors. Objectives: The study aims to evaluate how different levels of immersion in VR—high‐immersive VR (head‐mounted display, HMD‐VR) and low‐immersive VR (Desktop‐VR)—affect cognitive load and learning outcomes, focusing on procedural and declarative knowledge. Methods: A prospective experimental study was conducted with 74 sophomore nursing students, assigned to either the HMD‐VR group or Desktop‐VR. Eye‐tracking and electrodermal activity (EDA) were used to assess cognitive load during learning. A pre‐test/post‐test design measured declarative and procedural knowledge
