# Virtual Reality Simulation's Influence on Nursing Students' Anxiety and Communication Skills With Anxious Patients: A Pilot Study.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • Nursing students may be unprepared to communicate with anxious patients. • Full immersion virtual reality simulation can be used to reduce students' anxiety. • Less anxious students will have a more therapeutic nurse-patient relationship. Anxiety is the most prevalent mental health disorder in the United States and globally. Nurses do not feel adequately prepared to care for anxious patients, citing a lack of education in effective communication skills. Ineffective communication can negatively influence the therapeutic nurse-patient relationship and patient outcomes. Simulation methods such as high-fidelity simulation and standardized patients have decreased nursing students' anxiety levels in caring for anxious patients. The use of full immersion virtual reality simulation as an education modality has demonstrated success in nonhealthcare and medical education but is limited in nursing education. Thirty-three nursing students from two accredited registered nurse programs. A quasi-e
