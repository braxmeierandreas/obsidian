# The effect of three different simulation methods used in urinary catheterization training.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • Task-trainer models are suitable for teaching basic psychomotor skills. • High-fidelity simulation is inadequate in increasing student satisfaction and self-confidence. • Virtual reality technology positively affects students' interest in practice. This study was designed as a randomized study to determine the effects of three different simulation methods used in urinary catheterization training on nursing students' skills, satisfaction and self-confidence. The students were divided into three groups and each group experienced urinary catheterization with a different simulation method. Students' skill levels from the highest to lowest were determined as the virtual reality simulation group, task-trainer simulation group, high-fidelity simulation group and there was a statistically significant difference between their mean scores. It was determined that the students' satisfaction and self-confidence total score averages were similar in the virtual reality simulation group and the tas
