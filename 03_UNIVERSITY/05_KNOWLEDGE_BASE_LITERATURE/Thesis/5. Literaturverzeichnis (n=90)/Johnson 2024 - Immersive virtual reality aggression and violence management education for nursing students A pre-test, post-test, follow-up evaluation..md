# Immersive virtual reality aggression and violence management education for nursing students: A pre-test, post-test, follow-up evaluation.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • Virtual reality (VR) education improves student confidence in aggression and violence management. • One 15-20-minute VR exposure resulted in large confidence improvements. • Confidence improvements appear to persist over a four-month period. • VR is easy-to-use and can improve aggression and violence education accessibility. Nursing students attending clinical placement encounter similar exposure to aggression and violence as qualified clinicians. Universities encounter barriers in aggression and violence management education delivery due to resourcing and time requirements. Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) education may reduce barriers while maintaining comparable learning outcomes to face-to-face simulation-based education. Nursing students (n = 72), recruited from one public university in Perth, Western Australia, completed a 15-20 minute IVR education program. Pre-, post-, and 4-month post-intervention questionnaires investigated self-reported confidence. Cross-sectional data wer
