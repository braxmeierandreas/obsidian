# Effects of immersive virtual reality simulation–based maternity nursing education: A randomized controlled trial.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • Technology can augment methods for educating students of various ages. • With virtual reality, medical procedures can be learned without risk to patients. • Simulated maternity nursing training is associated with student satisfaction. • vSim has limitations that affect its usefulness for nursing training. • The newly designed program provides more effective simulated training. We investigated the impact of an immersive virtual reality (IVR)-based scenario simulation education program as an alternative to traditional maternity nursing practicums. A simulation maternity nursing class at Wonkwang University in South Korea was conducted with 59 junior nursing students (experimental group = 30, control group = 29). This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of the IVR simulation on students' knowledge, satisfaction, self-efficacy, and confidence in delivering nursing care. We conducted data collection from September 2021 to February 2022. SPSS version 25.0 was used for data a
