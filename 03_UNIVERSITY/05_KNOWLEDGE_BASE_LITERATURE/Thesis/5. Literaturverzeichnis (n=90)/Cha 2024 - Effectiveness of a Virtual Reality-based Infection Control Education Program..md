# Effectiveness of a Virtual Reality-based Infection Control Education Program.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> Purpose: This study evaluated the effect of virtual reality (VR)-based infection control (IC) education program on IC knowledge, awareness, performance confidence, and self-efficacy in nursing students. Methods: A single-group pretest-posttest design was employed. The study participants consisted of 86 nursing students. The VR-based IC education program was developed by applying the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) model. The subject of the VR-based IC education program was isolation precautions. The effects of the VR-based educational program were measured via a questionnaire. Results: There were no significant differences in IC knowledge before and after the VR-based IC education program. However, IC awareness (t=2.31, p=.023), IC performance confidence (t=2.19, p=.031), and self-efficacy (t=3.43, p=.001) exhibited statistically significant increases after the VR-based IC education program. Satisfaction with the VR-based IC education program was rela
