# Preliminary Evaluation of Experiential Learning–Based Fall and Medication Error Prevention Education (EFMPE) using a Virtual Reality Room of Errors Program: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> Purpose: Falls and medication errors are the most common patient safety incidents globally. Kolb's experiential learning theory supports the application of cognitive learning in clinical settings. This study examined the effectiveness of Experiential Learning–Based Fall and Medication Error Prevention Education (EFMPE), utilizing virtual reality and room of errors. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 28 fourth-year nursing students (15 experimental, 13 control). The experimental group participated in EFMPE from February 1 to 6, 2024, comprising six sessions of 2 hours each. The control group received traditional lectures. Safety control confidence and course interest were measured before and immediately after the intervention; safety control confidence was reassessed 6 weeks later. Results: Both groups showed immediate improvement; however, only the experimental group sustained increased safety control confidence after 6 weeks (Wald χ² = 13.21, p&lt;.001). Cours
