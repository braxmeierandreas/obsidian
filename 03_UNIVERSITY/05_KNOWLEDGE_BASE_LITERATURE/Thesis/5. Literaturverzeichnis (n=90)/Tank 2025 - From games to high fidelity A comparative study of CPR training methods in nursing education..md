# From games to high fidelity: A comparative study of CPR training methods in nursing education.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • Game-based virtual reality (VR) training demonstrated higher knowledge retention at three- and six-months post-training compared to other simulation methods. • Students trained with VR achieved higher practical skill scores immediately after training compared to those using high- and low-fidelity simulations. • VR simulation offers a cost-effective and accessible alternative to traditional high-fidelity simulators, promoting flexibility and frequency in learning. • The use of VR aligns with the technological familiarity and preferences of students, enhancing their motivation, self-confidence, and learning engagement. Clinical simulation is a promising teaching strategy for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training and basic life support (BLS) education. However, the effectiveness of different simulation-based methods in CPR training requires further exploration. This study compares the effectiveness of three simulation-based methods—game-based virtual reality (VR), high-fidelity
