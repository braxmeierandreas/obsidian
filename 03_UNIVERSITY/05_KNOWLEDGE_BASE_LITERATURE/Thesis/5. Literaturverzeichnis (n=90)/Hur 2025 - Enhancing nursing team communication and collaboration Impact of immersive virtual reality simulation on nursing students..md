# Enhancing nursing team communication and collaboration: Impact of immersive virtual reality simulation on nursing students.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • Impact of an immersive virtual reality simulation (IVRS) program is examined. • The IVRS pilot improved nursing students' communication clarity. • Attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration and teamwork were also enhanced. Effective interprofessional communication and collaboration are essential for patient safety. This study evaluated the impact of an immersive virtual reality simulation (IVRS) program to enhance team communication and collaborative skills among nursing students. A pilot study was conducted with 20 nursing students to evaluate the IVRS program, which consists of two modules. They completed self-evaluations before and after the program on communication clarity, attitudes toward physician and nurse collaboration and teamwork attitudes. IVRS training significantly enhanced communication clarity (t = −4.68, p &lt;.001), attitudes towards physician–nurse collaboration (t = −3.94, p &lt;.001), and teamwork attitudes (t = −6.02, p &lt;.001). This pilot IVRS program
