# Immersive virtual reality simulation versus screen-based virtual simulation: An examination of learning outcomes in nursing education.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • VR and screen-based simulations show similar improvements in knowledge acquisition. • VR simulation leads to higher student satisfaction and self-confidence scores. • Both simulation types can effectively teach nursing content to first-year students. • VR may enhance student engagement, but cost-effectiveness needs further study. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) and screen-based (2D) virtual reality simulations are increasingly used in nursing education; however, research comparing their effectiveness is limited. This quasi-experimental study compared learning outcomes between IVR (n = 14) and screen-based (2D) virtual reality (n = 13) simulations among first-year nursing students. Both groups completed pre- and post-tests on orthopedic postoperative nursing management knowledge and a post-test survey on satisfaction and self-confidence. Both groups showed improvements in knowledge test scores, which were not statistically significant. The IVR group demonstrated significantly higher
