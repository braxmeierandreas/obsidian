# An Immersive Virtual Reality Simulation for Cross-Cultural Communication Skills: Development and Feasibility.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • Virtual reality simulation could close a gap in cultural competence education. • The content of a new virtual simulation was designed based on theoretical models. • The immersive virtual simulation had high levels of usability and satisfaction. Educational approaches proven to produce cultural competence among nurses, consistently and cost-effectively, are not yet widely available. This study describes the development and feasibility of an immersive virtual reality simulation to improve cross-cultural communication skills. We used a multi-methods approach, recruiting 15 nursing students from a nursing college in South Korea to assess the simulation's feasibility according to sense of presence, usability, simulation design, task difficulty, and satisfaction. This theory-based immersive virtual reality simulation was developed through content and face validity testing by expert panels. We identified high levels of usability, simulation design, and satisfaction, a low level of task dif
