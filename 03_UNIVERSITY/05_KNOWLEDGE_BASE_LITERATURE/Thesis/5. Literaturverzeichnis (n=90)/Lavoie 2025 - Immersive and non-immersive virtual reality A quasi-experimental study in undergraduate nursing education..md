# Immersive and non-immersive virtual reality: A quasi-experimental study in undergraduate nursing education.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • Immersive and nonimmersive VR effectively fostered engagement and learning. • Compared to nonimmersive VR, immersive VR increased confidence and enthusiasm. • Non-immersive VR emerged as a viable alternative with similar educational benefits. Immersive virtual reality (VR) is considered more engaging and realistic than non-immersive VR, but direct comparisons in nursing education are limited. This non-randomized quasi-experimental study explored undergraduate nursing students' experiences in a home care simulation experience using immersive VR at the university (via VR headsets) or non-immersive VR at home (desktop simulation). A post-test survey incorporating qualitative feedback assessed engagement, satisfaction, confidence in learning, cognitive load, mental effort, and clinical reasoning. Engagement levels were similar across VR modalities. Immersive VR participants reported higher confidence and enthusiasm, while non-immersive VR participants reported greater mental effort and
