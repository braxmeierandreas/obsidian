# Developing an immersive virtual reality medication administration scenario using the nominal group technique.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> This paper aims to describe how the Nominal Group Technique was applied to obtain focused content to develop medication administration error scenarios for future use to educate practicing RNs with immersive virtual reality simulation. In the United States, medication errors account for up to \$46 million in daily loss to hospital operational budgets. Each phase of prescribing, dispensing, administration, monitoring, and reconciliation is crucial in reducing potentially life-threatening outcomes associated with medication errors. Registered Nurses are responsible for safely administering diverse classifications of medications to patients in various healthcare settings. However, human and system factors can contribute to the exposure of hospitalized patients to a medication error. Virtual reality simulation-based education can be a methodology to educate practicing Registered Nurses on safe medication practices. A Nominal Group Technique process was used to generate consensus from partic
