# The role of experiential knowledge in hospital nurses' management of pain-related agitation in people with dementia: {An} expert performance simulation study.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> Pain-related agitation in hospital patients with dementia presents a diagnostic challenge as patients often cannot explain their agitation. Generally, a deductive process is required of staff, culminating in an analgesic trial. However, evidence suggests the deductions of hospital nurses may be flawed because they may not associate agitation in dementia with painful conditions, thereby missing key clinical cues. While analytical rule-based deduction applies explicit formal knowledge, cognitive scientists argue that tacit experiential knowledge, i.e., the unconscious classification of available cues, is equally important and is always involved. To identify the cognitive characteristics unique to nurses who accurately recognise pain-related agitation in a patient with dementia compared with nurses who do not. In this descriptive multivariate study, registered acute-care nurses undertook an original computerised virtual simulation requiring them to identify and manage pain-related agitat
