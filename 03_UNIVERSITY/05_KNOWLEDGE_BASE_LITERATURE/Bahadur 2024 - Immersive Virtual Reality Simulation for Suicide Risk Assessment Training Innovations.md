# Immersive Virtual Reality Simulation for Suicide Risk Assessment Training: Innovations in Mental Health Nursing Education.

> [!abstract] Abstract
> • First in the field of mental health nursing education to study iVRS technology. • Interactive suicide risk assessment training using the iVRS and dVRS. • Comparable educational outcomes for iVRS and dVRS. • Comparable user engagement for iVRS compared to dVRS. The complexity of psychiatric patient presentations requires the standardization of nursing education through simulation-based education to ensure essential skills development. Technological advances like virtual reality offer an innovative opportunity to enhance simulation-based nursing education. Our study aimed to improve nursing education by examining the impact of an immersive virtual reality simulation (iVRS)-based education program regarding suicide risk assessment (SRA) training on the educational outcomes, learner experience, and user satisfaction of nursing students, with comparison to a nonimmersive computer desktop version. Two VR SRA case scenarios were developed depicting virtual patients with acutely and chronic
