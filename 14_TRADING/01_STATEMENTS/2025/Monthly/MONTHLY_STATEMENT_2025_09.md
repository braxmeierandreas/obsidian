The Overview is presented in the primary currency of the account. For multi-currency transactions, the amounts are converted using the live interbank exchange rates at the time of the

transaction.

currency is converted using the live exchange rate from the last day of the month for which this statement is generated.


All transactions' execution times are in UTC.


Invest transactions executed on an exchange follow the standard equity settlement cycle of trade date plus two days (T+2), although this period may occasionally be extended due to

[operational reasons. As outlined in our Terms, in the unlikely scenario that a transaction fails to settle, it will be cancelled, and your account will revert to its state before the transaction took](https://www.trading212.com/EN/legal-documentation)
