Disclosures


The Overview is presented in the primary currency of the account. For multi-currency transactions, the amounts are converted using the live interbank exchange rates at the time of the

transaction.


The Cash breakdown displays the value of each currency wallet in its respective currency and also in the primary currency of your account. The value shown in the primary account

currency is converted using the live exchange rate from the last day of the month for which this statement is generated.


All transactions' execution times are in UTC.


Invest transactions executed on an exchange follow the standard equity settlement cycle of trade date plus two days (T+2), although this period may occasionally be extended due to

[operational reasons. As outlined in our Terms, in the unlikely scenario that a transaction fails to settle, it will be cancelled, and your account will revert to its state before the transaction took](https://www.trading212.com/EN/legal-documentation)

place. Your statement, received at the time of a transaction, will state if the specific transaction was executed on an exchange.


Where a portfolio transfer was executed in your Invest Account, the execution price for Transfer in would be the price at which an investment was bought, as provided by the client during

the transfer. Its accuracy is the sole responsibility of the client. For Transfer out, the execution price would be the price at which the investment was bought.


The statement includes pending orders as of the time it is generated; any orders placed or cancelled afterwards are not shown. Clients are encouraged to regularly check their account

activity on the online platform to stay informed of any changes.
