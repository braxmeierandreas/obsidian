Disclosures


The Overview is presented in the primary currency of the account. For multi-currency transactions, the amounts are converted using the live interbank exchange rates at the time of the

transaction.


The Cash breakdown displays the value of each currency wallet in its respective currency and also in the primary currency of your account. The value shown in the primary account

currency is converted using the live exchange rate from the last day of the month for which this statement is generated.


All transactions' execution times are in UTC.


When you execute Invest transactions on an exchange, they typically settle within two or three days, in line with the specific rules of the respective market. There might be rare occasions

[where this settlement cycle extends due to operational factors. As outlined in our Terms, in the unlikely scenario that a transaction fails to settle, it will be cancelled, and your account will](https://www.trading212.com/EN/legal-documentation)

revert to its state before the transaction took place. You can review the details of your transactions in the Account activity statement and Order history, where the execution venue of each

transaction is indicated


Where a portfolio transfer was executed in your Invest Account, the execution price for Transfer in would be the price at which an investment was bought, as provided by the client during

the transfer. Its accuracy is the sole responsibility of the client. For Transfer out, the execution price would be the price at which the investment was bought.


The statement reflects pending orders at the time of statement generation. Any orders placed or cancelled after this time will not be reflected in the statement. We recommend you review

your account activity regularly through our online platform to stay up-to-date on any changes to your pending orders.


The Share lending summary reflects the interest accrued from the share lending program this month. The interest earned is based on your participation as detailed in the 'Share Lending'
